What is the primary purpose of covalent bonds in molecular compounds?
To share electrons between atoms, creating stable molecules with specific geometries and properties.

What is the difference between single, double, and triple covalent bonds?
Single bonds share one pair of electrons, double bonds share two pairs, and triple bonds share three pairs, with increasing bond strength and decreasing length.

What is the primary purpose of metallic bonding in metals?
To create a "sea of electrons" that gives metals their characteristic properties of conductivity, malleability, and luster.

What is the difference between metallic bonding and ionic bonding?
Metallic bonding involves delocalized electrons shared among many metal atoms, while ionic bonding involves transfer of electrons between metal and nonmetal atoms.
