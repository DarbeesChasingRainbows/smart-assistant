// Cloud Security Intermediate - Platform Protection & IAM Implementation

What is the primary difference between cloud security and traditional on-premises security?
Cloud security uses shared responsibility model where provider secures infrastructure while customer secures data and applications, while on-premises security requires full responsibility for all security layers.

What is the most effective method to implement secure access to cloud resources?
Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) with principle of least privilege, multi-factor authentication, and regular access reviews to minimize unauthorized access risks.

What is the primary purpose of cloud security groups and network ACLs?
Security groups control instance-level inbound/outbound traffic, while network ACLs control subnet-level traffic, providing layered network security in cloud environments.

What is the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS from a security responsibility perspective?
IaaS requires customer to manage OS, applications, and data security; PaaS shares responsibility for platform security; SaaS provider handles most security while customer manages data access and user accounts.

What is the most critical security consideration when configuring cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)?
Implement proper access controls, enable encryption at rest and in transit, configure bucket policies correctly, and regularly audit permissions to prevent data exposure.

What is the primary purpose of cloud logging and monitoring services?
To provide visibility into cloud resource usage, security events, and compliance status through centralized log collection, analysis, and alerting.

What is the difference between cloud-based firewalls and traditional hardware firewalls?
Cloud firewalls are virtual, scalable, and integrate with cloud services for dynamic protection, while hardware firewalls are physical appliances with fixed capacity and location constraints.

What is the most effective method to prevent data breaches in cloud environments?
Implement end-to-end encryption, strict access controls, regular security assessments, and comprehensive monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized data access.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing cloud-based containers?
Use secure base images, implement network segmentation, manage secrets properly, and regularly scan for vulnerabilities in container images and configurations.

What is the difference between cloud compliance frameworks and traditional compliance?
Cloud compliance requires understanding provider certifications, implementing proper data governance, and ensuring compliance across shared infrastructure boundaries.

What is the most effective method to secure cloud-based databases?
Implement encryption at rest and in transit, use database-specific IAM controls, enable audit logging, and regularly patch and update database systems.

What is the primary purpose of cloud security posture management (CSPM)?
To continuously monitor cloud configurations for compliance with security best practices and automatically detect misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.

What is the difference between cloud-based identity federation and traditional directory services?
Cloud federation enables single sign-on across multiple cloud services using standards like SAML/OIDC, while traditional directories typically serve on-premises applications.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing serverless computing?
Understand the shared responsibility model, implement proper function permissions, secure dependencies, and monitor for unauthorized function execution.

What is the primary security benefit of cloud-based security information and event management (SIEM)?
Centralized log collection and analysis across cloud services with automated threat detection, compliance monitoring, and incident response capabilities.

What is the difference between cloud-based backup and traditional backup solutions?
Cloud backups offer scalability, geographic distribution, and automated management, while traditional backups provide physical control but require manual management and infrastructure.

What is the most effective method to implement secure DevOps in cloud environments?
Integrate security into CI/CD pipelines, implement infrastructure as code with security scanning, use secrets management, and automate compliance checks.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing multi-cloud environments?
Standardize security policies across providers, implement consistent identity management, and ensure data protection and compliance across all cloud platforms.

What is the difference between cloud-based DDoS protection and traditional mitigation?
Cloud DDoS protection offers massive scalability and global distribution, while traditional mitigation relies on on-premises equipment with limited capacity.

What is the most effective method to prevent cloud misconfigurations?
Use infrastructure as code with security templates, implement automated compliance checking, conduct regular security assessments, and provide security training for cloud teams.

What is the primary purpose of cloud-based web application firewalls (WAF)?
To protect web applications from common attacks like SQL injection and XSS with cloud-native integration, automatic updates, and scalability to handle traffic spikes.

What is the difference between cloud-based encryption and traditional encryption key management?
Cloud encryption offers integrated key management, automatic rotation, and hardware security modules, while traditional key management requires manual infrastructure and processes.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing cloud-based APIs?
Implement proper authentication and authorization, use rate limiting, validate all inputs, and monitor API usage for unusual patterns or abuse.

What is the primary security benefit of cloud-based threat intelligence services?
Real-time threat data integration with automated protection, global threat visibility, and continuous updates on emerging threats and attack patterns.

What is the difference between cloud-based vulnerability management and traditional scanning?
Cloud vulnerability management integrates with cloud services, understands cloud-specific configurations, and can automatically remediate certain issues through APIs.

What is the most effective method to ensure cloud data privacy and compliance?
Implement data classification, use encryption and access controls, understand data residency requirements, and maintain comprehensive audit trails for compliance reporting.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing cloud-based machine learning services?
Secure training data, protect model endpoints, implement proper authentication, and monitor for adversarial attacks or model poisoning.

What is the difference between cloud-based security automation and traditional manual security processes?
Cloud security automation offers rapid response, consistent policy enforcement, and scalability, while manual processes are slower, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

What is the most effective method to implement secure cloud architecture?
Use defense in depth with multiple security layers, implement zero-trust principles, ensure proper network segmentation, and regularly test security controls.

This intermediate cloud security deck provides essential knowledge for implementing secure cloud platforms, managing access controls, and ensuring compliance in modern cloud environments.
