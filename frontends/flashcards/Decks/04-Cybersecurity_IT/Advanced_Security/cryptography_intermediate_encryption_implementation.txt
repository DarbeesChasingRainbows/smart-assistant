// Cryptography Intermediate - Encryption Implementation & Key Management

What is the primary difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms?
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (faster, suitable for bulk data), while asymmetric encryption uses public/private key pairs (slower, enables secure key exchange and digital signatures).

What is the most effective method to securely exchange symmetric encryption keys over insecure channels?
Use asymmetric encryption (like RSA) to encrypt the symmetric key, or implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange for perfect forward secrecy.

What is the primary purpose of a digital signature in cryptography?
To provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation by allowing verification of message origin and ensuring the message hasn't been altered.

What is the difference between hashing and encryption in cryptographic applications?
Hashing is a one-way function that creates fixed-length output for data integrity verification, while encryption is a two-way function that protects confidentiality and allows decryption.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing password storage?
Use strong, slow hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2) with unique salts per password to prevent rainbow table attacks and brute force cracking.

What is the primary purpose of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?
To manage digital certificates and public-key encryption, providing framework for secure communication, authentication, and trust relationships.

What is the difference between block ciphers and stream ciphers?
Block ciphers encrypt fixed-size blocks of data (AES, DES), while stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time (RC4), making stream ciphers suitable for real-time communications.

What is the most effective method to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks in encrypted communications?
Implement proper certificate validation with certificate pinning, use trusted certificate authorities, and verify certificate chains and revocation status.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing cryptographic key management?
Generate keys with sufficient entropy, store keys securely (HSM, key vaults), implement proper rotation policies, and ensure secure backup and recovery procedures.

What is the difference between confidentiality and integrity in cryptographic protection?
Confidentiality ensures data is not disclosed to unauthorized parties, while integrity ensures data is not altered or corrupted in transit or storage.

What is the most effective method to implement secure random number generation for cryptographic purposes?
Use cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) with entropy from multiple sources, avoiding standard random functions for security-critical operations.

What is the primary purpose of message authentication codes (MACs)?
To provide both integrity and authentication for messages, ensuring the message is from the claimed sender and hasn't been altered during transmission.

What is the difference between HMAC and digital signatures?
HMAC uses shared secret keys for efficiency, while digital signatures use public/private key pairs for non-repudiation and asymmetric authentication.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing TLS/SSL encryption?
Use modern protocols (TLS 1.2+), disable weak ciphers, implement perfect forward secrecy, and properly configure certificate validation.

What is the primary purpose of cryptographic salt in password hashing?
To prevent rainbow table attacks by adding unique random data to each password before hashing, ensuring identical passwords produce different hashes.

What is the difference between symmetric key algorithms AES and DES?
AES uses 128, 192, or 256-bit keys and is currently secure, while DES uses 56-bit keys and is considered insecure due to short key length.

What is the most effective method to protect data at rest in databases?
Implement column-level or database-level encryption with proper key management, access controls, and audit logging for encrypted data access.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing cryptographic algorithms in applications?
Use well-vetted, standard libraries rather than implementing custom cryptographic functions, as custom implementations are prone to vulnerabilities.

What is the difference between encryption and encoding in data handling?
Encryption protects confidentiality through mathematical algorithms, while encoding converts data format for transmission or storage without providing security.

What is the most effective method to implement secure key exchange protocols?
Use established protocols like Diffie-Hellman with proper parameter validation, or implement elliptic curve cryptography for improved efficiency and security.

What is the primary purpose of perfect forward secrecy in cryptographic protocols?
To ensure that compromise of long-term keys doesn't compromise past session keys, protecting historical communications even if current keys are exposed.

What is the difference between RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)?
RSA uses mathematical properties of large prime numbers, while ECC uses elliptic curve mathematics, providing equivalent security with smaller key sizes and better performance.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing cryptographic hash functions?
Use collision-resistant algorithms (SHA-256+, SHA-3) and avoid deprecated functions (MD5, SHA-1) for security-critical applications.

What is the primary purpose of initialization vectors (IVs) in block cipher encryption?
To ensure that identical plaintext blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks, preventing pattern analysis and improving security.

What is the difference between symmetric key distribution and asymmetric key distribution?
Symmetric key distribution requires secure channels to share secret keys, while asymmetric key distribution allows public key sharing without compromising private keys.

What is the most effective method to implement secure cryptographic key storage?
Use hardware security modules (HSMs), encrypted key vaults, or secure enclaves with proper access controls and audit logging.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing cryptographic protocols in IoT devices?
Balance security requirements with resource constraints, using lightweight cryptography when necessary and ensuring proper key management for device lifecycle.

What is the difference between stream cipher and block cipher modes of operation?
Stream cipher modes (CTR, OFB) convert block ciphers into stream ciphers for real-time encryption, while block cipher modes (CBC, ECB) encrypt data in fixed-size blocks.

What is the most effective method to verify cryptographic implementation security?
Conduct thorough code review, use established cryptographic libraries, perform penetration testing, and validate against known cryptographic standards and best practices.
