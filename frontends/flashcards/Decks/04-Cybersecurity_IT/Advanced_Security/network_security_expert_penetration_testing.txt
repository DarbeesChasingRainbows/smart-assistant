// Network Security & Penetration Testing Deck

What is the most effective method to bypass modern network intrusion detection systems when conducting authorized penetration testing?
Using encrypted command and control channels with legitimate protocol mimicry and low-and-slow techniques to avoid behavioral anomaly detection.

In Kerberos authentication, what is the Silver Ticket attack and how does it differ from Golden Ticket attacks?
Silver Ticket forges service tickets using a service account hash, providing access to specific services, while Golden Ticket uses krbtgt hash for unlimited domain-wide access.

What is the critical security difference between SMB signing and SMB encryption for lateral movement detection?
SMB signing provides integrity verification but can be bypassed, while SMB encryption provides confidentiality that makes network traffic analysis significantly more difficult.

When conducting network enumeration, what is the most stealthy technique for discovering internal services without triggering IDS alerts?
Using passive DNS reconnaissance combined with ARP table analysis and legitimate service discovery protocols rather than active port scanning.

In Active Directory security, what is the most dangerous misconfiguration that attackers commonly exploit?
Service Principal Names (SPNs) with weak service account passwords allowing Kerberoasting attacks for credential theft.

What is the primary advantage of using DCOM over WinRM for lateral movement in red team engagements?
DCOM provides native Windows authentication with minimal logging and leverages existing COM objects, making detection more difficult than WinRM which generates clearer audit trails.

When implementing network segmentation, what is the most critical security consideration for preventing east-west movement?
Implementing micro-segmentation with zero-trust principles and just-in-time access controls rather than traditional VLAN-based segmentation.

What is the most effective method to detect and prevent SMB relay attacks in enterprise networks?
Implementing SMB signing enforcement combined with network-level authentication and monitoring for unusual authentication patterns.

In network security monitoring, what is the most critical indicator of compromise for lateral movement?
Unusual authentication patterns with privileged account usage from atypical workstations and non-standard business hours.

What is the primary security weakness in most VPN implementations that attackers exploit?
Improper certificate management and weak authentication mechanisms allowing man-in-the-middle attacks and credential harvesting.

When conducting network security assessments, what is the most comprehensive approach to testing firewall configurations?
Combining policy review with active testing using legitimate traffic patterns and attempting known evasion techniques to validate rule effectiveness.

What is the most effective method to prevent ARP spoofing attacks in enterprise networks?
Dynamic ARP inspection with DHCP snooping and port security combined with network monitoring for anomalous ARP traffic.

In a network security architecture, what is the most critical component for preventing advanced persistent threats?
Network segmentation with inline security inspection and comprehensive monitoring combined with threat intelligence integration.

What is the primary attack vector in modern network attacks and how is it best mitigated?
Compromised credentials through phishing and social engineering. Best mitigation is multi-factor authentication with continuous authentication and behavioral analysis.

When implementing secure network protocols, what is the most critical consideration for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks?
Proper certificate validation with pinning and comprehensive trust store management combined with protocol downgrade prevention.

What is the most effective method to detect network reconnaissance activities?
Comprehensive baseline establishment with behavioral anomaly detection and threat intelligence integration to identify novel scanning patterns.

In network security operations, what is the most critical capability for incident response?
Network segmentation with automated isolation capabilities and comprehensive traffic analysis to contain and investigate security incidents.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing secure wireless networks?
Enterprise-grade encryption with proper authentication and regular security audits combined with rogue access point detection.

When conducting network penetration testing, what is the most effective method for maintaining persistence?
Using legitimate administrative tools and scheduled tasks with minimal network footprint combined with living-off-the-land techniques.

What is the most effective method to prevent network-based denial of service attacks?
Multi-layered protection with rate limiting, traffic scrubbing, and comprehensive monitoring combined with capacity planning and redundancy.

In network security architecture, what is the most critical component for maintaining resilience?
Defense-in-depth with multiple independent security controls and automated response capabilities to ensure continued operation during attacks.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing secure network access control?
Zero-trust network access with device posture checking and just-in-time access provisioning rather than traditional network-based access controls.
