// Network Security Intermediate - Protocols & Defense Mechanisms

What is the primary difference between TCP and UDP from a security perspective?
TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with built-in error checking and flow control, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication without reliability guarantees, making UDP more vulnerable to certain attacks but harder to intercept.

What is the most effective way to prevent ARP spoofing attacks on a local network?
Implement Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) combined with DHCP snooping and port security on switches to validate ARP packets and bind IP addresses to MAC addresses.

What is the primary purpose of a firewall in network security architecture?
To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, acting as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks.

What is the difference between stateful and stateless firewalls?
Stateful firewalls maintain context about active connections and make decisions based on connection state, while stateless firewalls filter packets based solely on individual packet headers without connection awareness.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing VPNs?
Using strong encryption protocols (AES-256) with proper certificate management and multi-factor authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access.

What is the primary function of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?
To monitor network traffic for suspicious activity or policy violations and generate alerts when potential threats are detected.

What is the difference between signature-based and anomaly-based IDS?
Signature-based IDS detects known threats using predefined patterns, while anomaly-based IDS identifies unusual behavior that deviates from established normal baselines.

What is the most effective method to prevent unauthorized wireless network access?
Implement WPA3 encryption with strong passwords, disable WPS, use MAC address filtering, and regularly monitor for rogue access points.

What is the primary purpose of network segmentation in security?
To divide a network into smaller, isolated segments to contain breaches, limit lateral movement, and apply appropriate security controls to different areas.

What is the most critical component of a secure network design?
Defense in depth - implementing multiple layers of security controls so that if one layer fails, others continue to provide protection.

What is the difference between a proxy server and a reverse proxy?
A proxy server forwards client requests to the internet, while a reverse proxy forwards internet requests to internal servers, hiding server identities and providing load balancing.

What is the most effective way to prevent DNS amplification attacks?
Implement DNS response rate limiting, use recursion restrictions, and configure DNS servers to reject queries from unauthorized sources.

What is the primary security benefit of using VLANs?
VLANs logically separate network traffic at Layer 2, preventing broadcast storms and containing potential security breaches within specific network segments.

What is the most critical consideration when configuring network access control (NAC)?
Implementing proper authentication and authorization before granting network access, combined with continuous monitoring and automated remediation for policy violations.

What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in network communications?
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (faster but requires secure key exchange), while asymmetric encryption uses public/private key pairs (slower but enables secure key exchange).

What is the most effective method to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on wireless networks?
Implement certificate-based authentication, use encrypted protocols (HTTPS, SSH), and validate server certificates to prevent session hijacking.

What is the primary purpose of a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in network architecture?
To create a buffer zone between the internal trusted network and external untrusted networks, typically housing public-facing services like web servers.

What is the most critical security consideration for IoT device deployment?
Implementing network isolation, strong authentication, regular firmware updates, and monitoring for anomalous behavior to prevent device compromise.

What is the difference between network-based and host-based intrusion detection?
Network-based IDS monitors network traffic for threats, while host-based IDS monitors individual systems for suspicious activities and internal compromises.

What is the most effective way to prevent lateral movement in enterprise networks?
Implement micro-segmentation, zero-trust architecture, and continuous monitoring of authentication patterns to detect and block unauthorized movement.

What is the primary security benefit of using Software-Defined Networking (SDN)?
Centralized control and visibility of network traffic, enabling rapid security policy deployment and automated threat response across the entire network.

What is the most critical consideration when implementing network logging and monitoring?
Capturing sufficient detail for forensic analysis while managing storage requirements and ensuring log integrity through proper protection and correlation.

What is the difference between blacklisting and whitelisting in network security?
Blacklisting blocks known threats while allowing everything else, while whitelisting allows only known good entities and blocks everything else by default.

What is the most effective method to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks?
Implementing rate limiting, traffic scrubbing services, CDN distribution, and having excess capacity to absorb attack traffic.

What is the primary security consideration for cloud network security?
Understanding shared responsibility model, implementing proper network segmentation, and using cloud-native security controls for traffic monitoring and threat detection.

What is the most critical component of network security incident response?
Having predefined playbooks for common attack types, with clear escalation procedures and automated containment capabilities to minimize damage.

This intermediate network security deck provides essential knowledge for understanding network protocols, defense mechanisms, and practical security implementation strategies.
