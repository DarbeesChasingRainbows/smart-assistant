// Malware Analysis Intermediate - Threat Assessment & Analysis Techniques

What is the primary difference between static and dynamic malware analysis?
Static analysis examines malware without execution by analyzing code, strings, and structure, while dynamic analysis observes malware behavior during execution in controlled environments.

What is the most effective method to safely execute malware for analysis?
Use virtual machines with isolated networks, snapshot capabilities for rollback, proper monitoring tools, and strict separation from production systems to prevent accidental infection.

What is the primary purpose of malware classification in threat assessment?
To categorize malware by type, behavior, and family to understand potential impact, develop detection signatures, and inform appropriate response strategies.

What is the difference between viruses and worms in malware classification?
Viruses require host programs to spread and replicate, while worms are self-replicating programs that can spread independently across networks without user interaction.

What is the most critical security consideration when setting up malware analysis environments?
Ensure complete network isolation, use dedicated hardware, implement proper backup and recovery procedures, and maintain strict access controls to prevent malware escape.

What is the primary purpose of reverse engineering in malware analysis?
To understand malware functionality, identify capabilities, extract configuration data, and develop countermeasures through detailed code analysis.

What is the difference between packers and cryptors in malware obfuscation?
Packers compress executable code to reduce size and hide structure, while cryptors encrypt malware to evade detection by security software and static analysis.

What is the most effective method to identify malware command and control (C2) communications?
Monitor network traffic for unusual connections, analyze DNS queries, examine hardcoded URLs and IPs, and use behavioral analysis to identify communication patterns.

What is the primary purpose of sandboxing in malware analysis?
To execute malware in controlled, isolated environments while monitoring its behavior, system interactions, and network communications without risking host system compromise.

What is the difference between file-based and fileless malware?
File-based malware requires storing executable files on disk, while fileless malware operates entirely in memory using legitimate system tools to avoid detection.

What is the most effective method to analyze malware persistence mechanisms?
Examine registry modifications, scheduled tasks, startup programs, system services, and other autostart locations to understand how malware maintains presence after reboot.

What is the primary purpose of malware behavior monitoring during dynamic analysis?
To capture system calls, file operations, registry changes, and network communications to understand malware functionality and impact on the system.

What is the difference between polymorphic and metamorphic malware?
Polymorphic malware changes its encryption signature with each infection, while metamorphic malware rewrites its own code to create completely new variants without using encryption.

What is the most effective method to extract malware configuration and indicators?
Use static analysis tools, examine strings and resources, analyze network protocols, and use debugging tools to extract embedded URLs, IPs, and encryption keys.

What is the primary purpose of malware family attribution in threat intelligence?
To group similar malware samples, track threat actor campaigns, understand attack patterns, and develop targeted defenses and detection methods.

What is the difference between backdoors and remote access trojans (RATs)?
Backdoors provide simple unauthorized access, while RATs offer comprehensive remote control capabilities including file manipulation, screen capture, and system monitoring.

What is the most effective method to analyze malware anti-analysis techniques?
Identify debugger detection, virtual machine evasion, timing delays, and code obfuscation methods to understand how malware attempts to avoid analysis and detection.

What is the primary purpose of YARA rules in malware detection?
To create pattern-based signatures for identifying malware families based on code strings, byte patterns, and structural characteristics for automated threat hunting.

What is the difference between spyware and adware in malware classification?
Spyware secretly monitors user activity and steals sensitive information, while adware displays unwanted advertisements and may track user behavior for marketing purposes.

What is the most effective method to determine malware impact and damage assessment?
Analyze modified files, stolen data, system changes, network communications, and persistence mechanisms to understand the full scope of compromise and potential damage.

What is the primary purpose of malware timeline analysis in incident response?
To reconstruct infection sequence, identify initial compromise vector, track malware activities, and determine duration and extent of attacker presence.

What is the difference between bootkits and rootkits in malware classification?
Bootkits infect system boot processes to load before operating system, while rootkits modify operating system kernel to hide malicious activities and maintain stealth.

What is the most effective method to share malware analysis findings with security community?
Publish detailed technical reports, share indicators of compromise, contribute to threat intelligence platforms, and collaborate with security researchers and vendors.

What is the primary purpose of malware deobfuscation techniques?
To reverse packing, encryption, and encoding methods to reveal original malware code for analysis, signature development, and understanding functionality.

What is the difference between ransomware and extortionware in malware classification?
Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption, while extortionware threatens to expose stolen data unless payment is made, combining data theft with extortion.

What is the most effective method to analyze mobile malware threats?
Examine application permissions, analyze network communications, review code for malicious behavior, and test in controlled mobile environments for Android and iOS platforms.

What is the primary purpose of malware forensics in incident investigation?
To preserve evidence, maintain chain of custody, analyze attacker tools and techniques, and support legal proceedings with technical findings and expert testimony.

What is the difference between botnets and peer-to-peer malware in communication architecture?
Botnets use centralized command and control servers, while peer-to-peer malware uses decentralized communication between infected hosts for resilience and stealth.

What is the most effective method to develop custom malware analysis tools?
Combine static and dynamic analysis techniques, integrate with threat intelligence feeds, automate common analysis tasks, and maintain flexibility for evolving malware threats.

This intermediate malware analysis deck provides essential knowledge for understanding malware types, analysis techniques, and threat assessment methodologies in cybersecurity.
