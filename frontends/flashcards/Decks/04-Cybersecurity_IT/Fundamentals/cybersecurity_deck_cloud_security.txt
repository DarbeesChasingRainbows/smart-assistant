// Cloud Security & DevSecOps Deck

What is the most critical security misconfiguration in cloud environments that attackers commonly exploit?
Overly permissive IAM roles with service principal credentials and excessive console access, providing persistent high-privilege access that's difficult to detect and revoke.

In cloud security, what is the most effective method to prevent data exfiltration from storage services?
Implementing client-side encryption with proper key management, access logging, data loss prevention controls, and comprehensive network security rules.

What is the primary security difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS from a shared responsibility model perspective?
IaaS requires customer responsibility for OS, applications, and data security; PaaS shares security of applications and data; SaaS primarily requires customer responsibility for data and user access management.

Cryptographic verification of all dependencies with reproducible builds, comprehensive secret management, and runtime integrity checking combined with automated security testing.

What is the most effective method to detect and prevent cloud credential compromise?
Implementing just-in-time access with temporary credentials, comprehensive audit logging, behavioral analysis, and automated credential rotation combined with anomaly detection.

In container security, what is the most critical vulnerability that attackers commonly exploit?
Running containers as root with excessive capabilities and vulnerable base images, allowing container escape and host system compromise.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing secure cloud-native applications?
Zero-trust architecture with micro-segmentation, service mesh security, and comprehensive monitoring combined with proper secret management.

When implementing secure infrastructure as code, what is the most effective method to prevent security misconfigurations?

Consistent security policies across all cloud providers with centralized monitoring and proper key management combined with comprehensive compliance management.

When implementing secure cloud storage, what is the most effective protection against ransomware?
Immutable storage with versioning, comprehensive access controls, regular backup testing, and automated anomaly detection combined with proper incident response.

What is the most effective method to detect cloud misconfigurations before attackers exploit them?
Continuous configuration monitoring with automated compliance checking, threat intelligence integration, and regular security assessments combined with change management.

In cloud network security, what is the most critical implementation that organizations commonly miss?
Proper network segmentation with micro-segmentation, just-in-time access controls, and comprehensive monitoring combined with threat intelligence integration.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing secure cloud-based CI/CD pipelines?
Comprehensive secret management with automated rotation, proper access controls, and integrity verification combined with security testing in pipelines.
