Scenario: A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw, accompanied by shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Vital signs: BP 160/95, HR 110, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air. ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.

Question: Which THREE anatomical structures are most critically affected in this patient's acute condition, and what is the primary pathophysiological mechanism? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Right coronary artery supplying the inferior myocardial wall
B) Left anterior descending artery supplying the anterior wall
C) Aortic valve preventing backflow into left ventricle
D) Pericardial space containing the heart within mediastinum
