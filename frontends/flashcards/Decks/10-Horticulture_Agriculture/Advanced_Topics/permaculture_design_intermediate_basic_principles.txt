// Permaculture Design Intermediate - Basic Principles & Applications

What is the primary difference between permaculture and conventional gardening?
Permaculture designs integrated systems mimicking natural ecosystems, while conventional gardening often focuses on individual elements without considering relationships.

What is the most important permaculture principle for beginners?
"Observe and Interact" - taking time to understand your site's patterns, problems, and opportunities before making changes.

What is the difference between permaculture zones and sectors?
Zones organize elements based on frequency of use (Zone 0-5), while sectors analyze external energies (sun, wind, water) moving through the site.

What is the primary purpose of zone planning in permaculture design?
Place frequently used elements closest to home for efficiency, while placing low-maintenance elements farther away.

What is the most common mistake made by beginning permaculture designers?
Trying to implement too many complex ideas at once instead of observing and starting with simple, high-impact changes.

What is the difference between a guild and companion planting?
A guild is a multi-species group with multiple beneficial relationships, while companion planting typically focuses on two-species beneficial pairings.

What is the primary benefit of using swales in landscape design?
Capture and slow rainwater runoff, allowing it to infiltrate soil and recharge groundwater while preventing erosion.

What is the most effective way to start applying permaculture on a small property?
Begin with Zone 1 - kitchen garden, herb spiral, and compost system closest to your home for immediate benefits and learning.

What is the difference between annual and perennial systems in permaculture?
Annual systems require yearly replanting and intensive management, while perennial systems provide long-term yields with reduced maintenance.

What is the primary purpose of stacking in permaculture design?
Create multiple vertical layers of plants (canopy, understory, shrubs, herbs, groundcover, roots) to maximize space and diversity.

What is the most common water harvesting technique for home landscapes?
Rain barrels connected to downspouts provide simple, effective water collection for irrigation needs.

What is the difference between edge effect and microclimate?
Edge effect refers to increased diversity at boundaries between ecosystems, while microclimate describes small areas with different conditions than surroundings.

What is the primary benefit of integrating animals into permaculture systems?
Animals provide pest control, fertilization, weed management, and food production while closing nutrient cycles.

What is the most effective way to create soil fertility in new permaculture gardens?
Sheet mulching (lasagna gardening) builds soil quickly by layering cardboard, compost, and organic materials without tilling.

What is the difference between patterns and details in permaculture design?
Patterns are broad-scale arrangements and relationships, while details are specific elements and species choices within those patterns.

What is the primary purpose of sector analysis?
Identify external energies (sun, wind, fire, water, wildlife) to design systems that work with rather than against natural forces.

What is the most common permaculture technique for urban gardens?
Vertical gardening and container systems maximize limited space while creating productive growing areas.

What is the difference between input-driven and self-maintaining systems?
Input-driven systems require external resources and management, while self-maintaining systems increasingly care for themselves over time.

What is the primary benefit of food forests compared to conventional gardens?
Food forests provide multiple yields with minimal maintenance while creating habitat and building soil through natural succession.

What is the most effective way to apply permaculture ethics to daily life?
Earth Care through conservation practices, People Care through community building, and Fair Share through responsible consumption.

What is the difference between intensive and extensive permaculture systems?
Intensive systems require frequent attention and high inputs for high yields, while extensive systems need minimal management for sustainable yields.

What is the primary purpose of diversity in permaculture design?
Diverse systems are more resilient to pests, diseases, and climate fluctuations while providing varied yields throughout seasons.

What is the most common permaculture design method for slopes?
Contour planting, terracing, and swales on contour slow water runoff, prevent erosion, and create growing space.

What is the difference between functional and ornamental design in permaculture?
Functional design prioritizes useful relationships and yields, while ornamental design focuses primarily on aesthetic appearance.

What is the primary benefit of closed-loop systems in permaculture?
Closed loops minimize waste by using outputs from one element as inputs for another, reducing external dependencies.

What is the most effective way to design for energy efficiency?
Place elements based on frequency of use, solar access, and natural patterns to reduce physical work and resource consumption.

What is the difference between natural building and conventional construction?
Natural building uses local, renewable materials and passive design principles, while conventional construction often relies on manufactured materials and mechanical systems.

What is the primary purpose of succession planning in permaculture?
Guide ecosystem development through stages, ensuring continuous yields while building increasingly complex and stable systems.

What is the most common mistake in urban permaculture design?
Not accounting for limited space, light restrictions, and neighbor considerations when designing intensive systems.

What is the difference between permaculture and organic gardening?
Permaculture is a design system for sustainable human settlements, while organic gardening primarily focuses on growing methods without synthetic inputs.

What is the primary benefit of applying permaculture principles to existing landscapes?
Gradually transform conventional gardens into more productive, resilient systems while maintaining existing functional elements.

This intermediate permaculture design deck provides practical knowledge for applying basic permaculture principles and techniques in home and community settings.
