// Soil Science Intermediate - Practical Applications & Problem Solving

What is the primary difference between soil texture and soil structure?
Soil texture refers to the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay particles, while soil structure describes how these particles are arranged into aggregates.

What is the most accurate method to determine soil texture in the field?
The ribbon test - squeeze moist soil between thumb and forefinger to form a ribbon; longer ribbons indicate higher clay content.

What is the primary purpose of a soil pH test before planting?
To determine nutrient availability and potential need for amendments, as pH affects which nutrients plants can absorb.

What is the difference between macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients in soil fertility?
Macro-nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) are needed in larger quantities, while micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, B, Mo, Cu, Zn, Cl, Ni) are required in smaller amounts.

What is the primary benefit of adding compost to garden soil?
Improves soil structure, increases organic matter, enhances water retention, and provides slow-release nutrients.

What is the difference between organic and inorganic fertilizers?
Organic fertilizers derive from living organisms and release nutrients slowly, while inorganic fertilizers are manufactured and provide immediately available nutrients.

What is the primary cause of soil compaction in residential gardens?
Repeated foot traffic, heavy equipment use, and working soil when wet compresses soil particles and reduces pore space.

What is the most effective way to improve drainage in heavy clay soil?
Add organic matter (compost, aged bark) and create raised beds or install drainage systems to improve water movement.

What is the difference between soil acidification and alkalization?
Acidification lowers pH (more acidic) often from excessive nitrogen use, while alkalization raises pH (more alkaline) typically from lime or hard water.

What is the primary purpose of a soil test for home gardeners?
To determine current nutrient levels, pH, and organic matter content to guide appropriate amendment applications.

What is the difference between soluble and slow-release fertilizers?
Soluble fertilizers provide immediately available nutrients that can leach quickly, while slow-release fertilizers break down gradually providing longer feeding.

What is the primary benefit of cover crops for soil health?
Prevent erosion, add organic matter, fix nitrogen (legumes), and improve soil structure through root growth.

What is the difference between mulch and compost?
Mulch is applied to soil surface for weed control and moisture retention, while compost is mixed into soil to improve structure and fertility.

What is the primary cause of nutrient leaching in sandy soils?
Large particle size and low water-holding capacity allow nutrients to wash through soil profile before plants can absorb them.

What is the most effective way to increase soil organic matter in established gardens?
Apply compost as top dressing, use mulch that decomposes, and plant cover crops or green manures.

What is the difference between cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation?
CEC measures soil's ability to hold nutrients, while base saturation indicates what percentage of those exchange sites are occupied by basic cations.

What is the primary purpose of soil amendments in container gardening?
To provide proper drainage, adequate water retention, and balanced nutrition in the limited root environment.

What is the difference between complete and incomplete fertilizers?
Complete fertilizers contain all three primary nutrients (N, P, K), while incomplete fertilizers lack one or more of these nutrients.

What is the primary benefit of mycorrhizal fungi in soil?
Extend root surface area, improve nutrient and water uptake, and enhance plant resistance to soil-borne diseases.

What is the most effective way to correct iron deficiency in alkaline soils?
Apply chelated iron or lower soil pH with elemental sulfur, as high pH locks iron in unavailable forms.

What is the difference between soil salinity and sodicity?
Salinity refers to total soluble salts, while sodicity specifically indicates high sodium levels that can damage soil structure.

What is the primary purpose of soil testing before lawn fertilization?
To prevent over-application that can pollute waterways and ensure nutrients are actually needed for optimal growth.

What is the difference between granular and liquid fertilizers?
Granular fertilizers provide slow-release nutrition and are easier to apply evenly, while liquid fertilizers provide quick uptake but require more frequent application.

What is the primary cause of pH drift in container soils?
Fertilizer type and irrigation water quality gradually change pH over time through chemical reactions and salt accumulation.

What is the most effective way to improve water retention in sandy soils?
Add organic matter (compost, peat moss) and use mulch to reduce evaporation and increase water-holding capacity.

What is the difference between synthetic and natural soil amendments?
Synthetic amendments are manufactured chemicals, while natural amendments derive from plant, animal, or mineral sources.

What is the primary benefit of soil solarization?
Kills soil-borne pathogens, weed seeds, and nematodes using solar heat trapped under clear plastic.

What is the difference between macro-pores and micro-pores in soil?
Macro-pores allow air movement and rapid drainage, while micro-pores hold water available to plant roots.

What is the most effective way to prevent soil erosion on slopes?
Plant groundcover, install terraces or swales, and apply mulch to protect soil surface from water impact.

What is the primary purpose of soil pH adjustment for different plant groups?
Optimize nutrient availability and create growing conditions suitable for specific plant requirements (acid-loving vs. alkaline-preferring).
