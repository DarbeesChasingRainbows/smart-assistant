// Propagation Techniques Intermediate - Basic Methods & Home Applications

What is the primary difference between sexual and asexual plant propagation?
Sexual propagation uses seeds creating genetic variation, while asexual propagation produces genetically identical plants from vegetative parts.

What is the most important factor for successful seed germination?
Consistent moisture, proper temperature, and adequate oxygen - seeds need water to activate enzymes but can't be waterlogged.

What is the difference between scarification and stratification in seed treatment?
Scarification breaks physical seed coats to allow water absorption, while stratification provides cold treatment to break physiological dormancy.

What is the primary benefit of starting seeds indoors rather than direct sowing?
Extends growing season, provides controlled environment for germination, and protects seeds from pests and weather.

What is the most common cause of seedling failure after germination?
Damping off disease caused by overwatering and poor air circulation, leading to stem rot at soil line.

What is the difference between softwood and hardwood cuttings?
Softwood cuttings are taken from new growth in spring, while hardwood cuttings are taken from dormant mature wood in late fall or winter.

What is the primary purpose of rooting hormone in cuttings?
Stimulates root initiation and increases success rates by providing auxin hormones that encourage cell division at cut ends.

What is the most effective way to prevent cuttings from wilting before rooting?
Maintain high humidity around cuttings through misting, humidity domes, or covering with plastic bags.

What is the difference between heel cuttings and straight cuttings?
Heel cuttings include a small section of older wood at the base, while straight cuttings are taken cleanly without attached older tissue.

What is the primary benefit of using bottom heat for propagation?
Increases rooting speed and success rates by maintaining optimal root zone temperature (70-75°F) for root development.

What is the most common method for propagating houseplants?
Stem cuttings placed in water or well-draining media, providing simple and reliable propagation for most popular houseplants.

What is the difference between division and layering propagation?
Division separates established plant clumps into smaller sections, while layering roots stems while still attached to parent plant.

What is the primary purpose of removing lower leaves from cuttings?
Reduces water loss through transpiration and prevents leaves from rotting when inserted into propagation media.

What is the most effective propagation media for most cuttings?
Well-draining mix of perlite and peat moss or coco coir, providing moisture retention while preventing rot.

What is the difference between simple layering and air layering?
Simple layering bends stems to ground level, while air layering roots stems while still attached above ground without burying the stem.

What is the primary benefit of grafting fruit trees?
Combines desirable fruit characteristics of scion with disease resistance and vigor of rootstock, maintaining true-to-type fruit production.

What is the most common type of grafting for home gardeners?
Whip grafting or splice grafting for similar diameter scions and rootstocks, providing reliable union formation.

What is the difference between budding and grafting?
Budding uses single buds inserted under bark, while grafting uses larger scion pieces with multiple buds.

What is the primary purpose of callus formation in graft unions?
Callus tissue forms bridge between scion and rootstock before vascular connection, essential for successful graft take.

What is the most effective way to propagate succulent plants?
Leaf cuttings or stem cuttings allowed to callus before planting in well-draining soil to prevent rot.

What is the difference between herbaceous and woody plant propagation?
Herbaceous plants root quickly from soft cuttings, while woody plants often require specific timing and hormone treatments.

What is the primary benefit of using mist systems for cutting propagation?
Maintains constant leaf moisture to prevent wilting while roots form, significantly increasing success rates.

What is the most common method for propagating perennial flowers?
Division of established clumps in spring or fall, providing reliable propagation and rejuvenation of mature plants.

What is the difference between seed viability and seed vigor?
Viability indicates if seeds can germinate, while vigor measures seedling growth rate and health after germination.

What is the primary purpose of acclimatization for propagated plants?
Gradually expose tender plants to outdoor conditions to prevent shock and ensure successful transition to garden environment.

What is the most effective way to store seeds for long-term viability?
Cool, dry, dark conditions with low humidity, using airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption and fungal growth.

What is the difference between monocot and dicot seed propagation?
Monocots (grasses, lilies) have one seed leaf and often need different germination conditions than dicots with two seed leaves.

What is the primary benefit of propagating from cuttings rather than seeds?
Produces genetically identical plants maintaining desirable characteristics, often faster than growing from seed.

What is the most common mistake in home propagation attempts?
Overwatering leading to rot, or underwatering causing desiccation - maintaining proper moisture balance is critical.

This intermediate propagation techniques deck provides practical knowledge for successful plant propagation at home using basic methods and common techniques.
