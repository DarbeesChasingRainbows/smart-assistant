// Water Management Intermediate - Irrigation Basics & Conservation

What is the primary difference between drip irrigation and overhead sprinkler systems?
Drip irrigation delivers water directly to plant root zones with 90-95% efficiency, while overhead sprinklers water the entire area with 50-70% efficiency.

What is the most important factor in determining irrigation frequency?
Soil type and current moisture levels - sandy soils need frequent light watering, while clay soils need less frequent deep watering.

What is the difference between evapotranspiration and transpiration?
Evapotranspiration includes both water loss from soil surface (evaporation) and plant leaves (transpiration), while transpiration is only plant water loss.

What is the primary benefit of mulching for water conservation?
Reduces soil surface evaporation by 30-50%, moderates soil temperature, and suppresses water-competing weeds.

What is the most effective way to determine when to water container plants?
Check soil moisture 1-2 inches deep - water when soil feels dry to touch, not on fixed schedule.

What is the difference between spray irrigation and soaker hose systems?
Spray systems distribute water through the air, while soaker hoses weep water directly into soil along their length.

What is the primary cause of overwatering in container plants?
Watering on schedule rather than based on plant needs, leading to root rot and oxygen deprivation in root zone.

What is the most effective way to improve water efficiency in vegetable gardens?
Apply drip irrigation with mulch and water in early morning to reduce evaporation losses.

What is the difference between capillary action and gravity in soil water movement?
Capillary action moves water upward and sideways through small soil pores, while gravity pulls water downward through larger pores.

What is the primary purpose of soil moisture sensors?
Provide objective data on soil water content to optimize irrigation timing and prevent over or under watering.

What is the most common sign of underwater stress in plants?
Wilting leaves, especially during hottest part of day, along with dull or grayish leaf color.

What is the difference between micro-sprinklers and drip irrigation?
Micro-sprinklers spray water in small patterns, while drip irrigation applies water slowly at specific points.

What is the primary benefit of rainwater harvesting for garden irrigation?
Provides free, naturally soft water without chlorine, reduces municipal water usage, and lowers water bills.

What is the most effective way to prevent water runoff on sloped gardens?
Install terraces, swales, or contour planting to slow water movement and increase infiltration.

What is the difference between hydrophilic and hydrophobic soils?
Hydrophilic soils absorb water readily, while hydrophobic soils repel water due to organic coatings or extreme dryness.

What is the primary cause of poor drainage in most garden soils?
Compaction from foot traffic or equipment, preventing water infiltration and root growth.

What is the most effective way to conserve water in established landscapes?
Apply 2-3 inches of organic mulch, use drought-tolerant plants, and water deeply but infrequently.

What is the difference between subsurface irrigation and surface drip systems?
Subsurface irrigation delivers water below soil surface, eliminating evaporation losses, while surface drip applies water at ground level.

What is the primary benefit of grouping plants by water needs?
Allows efficient irrigation by watering high-water-use plants separately from drought-tolerant plants.

What is the most common mistake in lawn irrigation?
Watering too frequently and shallowly, promoting weak root systems and wasting water through evaporation.

What is the difference between permanent and temporary irrigation systems?
Permanent systems are installed underground with automated controls, while temporary systems can be moved and reconfigured as needed.

What is the primary purpose of irrigation controllers?
Automate watering schedules, prevent overwatering during rain, and optimize watering times for plant needs.

What is the most effective way to check irrigation system efficiency?
Place catch cans or containers throughout irrigated area to measure water distribution uniformity.

What is the difference between xeriscaping and traditional landscaping?
Xeriscaping uses drought-tolerant plants and water-conserving practices, while traditional landscaping often requires more irrigation.

What is the primary cause of water waste in most home irrigation systems?
Overspray onto paved areas, leaks, and watering during hot or windy periods when evaporation is highest.

What is the most effective way to water newly planted trees and shrubs?
Apply water slowly to root ball area and surrounding soil, ensuring deep penetration to encourage root establishment.

What is the difference between flow rate and pressure in irrigation systems?
Flow rate measures water volume delivered over time, while pressure measures force pushing water through the system.

What is the primary benefit of using compost for water conservation?
Improves soil structure, increases water-holding capacity, and provides slow-release nutrients for healthy plant growth.

What is the most effective way to prevent soil erosion during heavy rainfall?
Maintain ground cover, use mulch, and create swales or terraces to slow water flow across the surface.

This intermediate water management deck provides practical knowledge for efficient irrigation and water conservation in home and landscape settings.
