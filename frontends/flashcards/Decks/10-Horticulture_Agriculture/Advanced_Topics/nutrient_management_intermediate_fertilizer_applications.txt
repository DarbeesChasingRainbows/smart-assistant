// Nutrient Management Intermediate - Fertilizer Applications & Plant Nutrition

What is the primary difference between macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients?
Macro-nutrients (N, P, K) are needed in large quantities for plant growth, while micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, etc.) are required in small amounts for specific functions.

What is the most important factor in fertilizer selection?
Plant needs and soil test results - matching fertilizer analysis to specific nutrient requirements prevents waste and deficiency.

What is the difference between complete and incomplete fertilizers?
Complete fertilizers contain all three primary nutrients (N, P, K), while incomplete fertilizers lack one or more of these essential nutrients.

What is the primary purpose of nitrogen in plant growth?
Promotes leafy green growth and vegetative development - essential for chlorophyll production and protein synthesis.

What is the most common sign of nitrogen deficiency in plants?
Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis) starting from bottom of plant, with stunted growth and weak stems.

What is the difference between quick-release and slow-release fertilizers?
Quick-release provides immediately available nutrients, while slow-release gradually breaks down providing longer feeding with less leaching.

What is the primary purpose of phosphorus in plant development?
Essential for root development, flower and fruit production, and energy transfer within plant cells.

What is the most effective way to apply phosphorus fertilizers?
Band placement near root zone or incorporate into soil before planting, as phosphorus moves very little in soil.

What is the difference between organic and synthetic fertilizers?
Organic fertilizers derive from natural sources and release nutrients slowly, while synthetic fertilizers are manufactured and provide immediately available nutrients.

What is the primary purpose of potassium in plant health?
Regulates water movement, disease resistance, and enzyme activation - essential for overall plant vigor and stress tolerance.

What is the most common cause of fertilizer burn in garden plants?
Over-application of soluble fertilizers or applying to dry plants, causing salt damage to root systems.

What is the difference between granular and liquid fertilizers?
Granular fertilizers provide slow-release nutrition and are easier to apply evenly, while liquid fertilizers provide quick uptake but require frequent application.

What is the primary purpose of secondary nutrients (calcium, magnesium, sulfur)?
Essential for plant structure, photosynthesis, and protein development - often needed in specific soil conditions.

What is the most effective way to prevent nutrient leaching in sandy soils?
Use slow-release fertilizers, apply smaller frequent applications, and maintain adequate organic matter to improve nutrient holding capacity.

What is the difference between soil pH and nutrient availability?
Soil pH affects which nutrients are available to plants - most nutrients are available in slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0-7.0).

What is the primary purpose of micronutrients in plant nutrition?
Required in small amounts for specific enzyme functions, photosynthesis, and disease resistance - deficiencies cause specific symptoms.

What is the most common micronutrient deficiency in alkaline soils?
Iron deficiency causing interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on new growth, as high pH locks iron in unavailable forms.

What is the difference between foliar feeding and soil application?
Foliar feeding provides quick nutrient uptake through leaves for immediate needs, while soil application provides long-term nutrition through root system.

What is the primary purpose of fertilizer timing in vegetable gardens?
Apply nutrients when plants can use them most effectively - nitrogen during vegetative growth, phosphorus during flowering/fruiting.

What is the most effective way to fertilize container plants?
Use diluted liquid fertilizers applied frequently during growing season, as containers leach nutrients quickly with regular watering.

What is the difference between organic matter and fertilizer?
Organic matter improves soil structure and provides slow-release nutrients, while fertilizers provide concentrated nutrients for immediate plant use.

What is the primary purpose of compost tea in plant nutrition?
Provides soluble nutrients and beneficial microorganisms that improve soil biology and plant health.

What is the most common mistake in home fertilizer applications?
Applying too much nitrogen leading to excessive vegetative growth at expense of flowers and fruits.

What is the difference between complete and balanced fertilizers?
Complete fertilizers contain N, P, K, while balanced fertilizers have equal or near-equal proportions of these nutrients.

What is the primary purpose of calcium in fruit production?
Prevents blossom end rot and improves fruit quality by strengthening cell walls and regulating nutrient movement.

What is the most effective way to correct magnesium deficiency?
Apply Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) as soil drench or foliar spray, especially for tomatoes and roses.

What is the difference between synthetic chelated and natural micronutrients?
Chelated micronutrients are protected from soil reactions making them more available, while natural forms may become locked in unavailable forms.

What is the primary purpose of sulfur in plant nutrition?
Essential for protein synthesis and disease resistance - often deficient in sandy soils with low organic matter.

What is the most effective way to fertilize established trees and shrubs?
Apply fertilizer to drip line area where feeder roots are concentrated, not near trunk where large roots provide structural support.

What is the difference between pre-plant and top-dressing fertilizer applications?
Pre-plant fertilizers are incorporated into soil before planting, while top-dressing is applied to soil surface around growing plants.

What is the primary purpose of nutrient management planning?
Prevents over-application, reduces environmental impact, and ensures plants receive appropriate nutrition for optimal growth.

This intermediate nutrient management deck provides practical knowledge for proper fertilizer selection and application in home and landscape settings.
