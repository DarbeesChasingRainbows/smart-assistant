Scenario: A client in Zone 6b presents with a vegetable garden showing chlorotic interveinal patterns on older leaves of tomatoes and beans, while new growth appears normal. Soil pH is 7.8, EC is 1.2 dS/m, and the soil is a silty clay loam with poor drainage. The client has been applying 10-10-10 fertilizer monthly.

Question: Which THREE interventions are most appropriate? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Apply elemental sulfur to lower pH to 6.5-7.0
B) Incorporate gypsum (CaSO₄) at 2-3 lbs per 100 sq ft
C) Add chelated iron as a foliar spray
D) Increase nitrogen application with urea
E) Install drainage tiles or French drain
F) Apply compost tea to increase microbial activity

Answer: B, C, E

Rationale:
- B) Correct because gypsum improves soil structure, provides calcium without affecting pH, and helps alleviate interveinal chlorosis in high pH soils by improving nutrient availability
- C) Correct because chelated iron bypasses high pH lockout, providing immediate relief for iron deficiency symptoms while soil amendments take effect
- E) Correct because poor drainage in clay soils contributes to nutrient uptake problems and root stress; addressing drainage is fundamental to long-term solution
- A) Incorrect because elemental sulfur acts too slowly (6-12 months) for acute symptoms and may further complicate nutrient availability in the short term
- D) Incorrect because excessive nitrogen can exacerbate micronutrient deficiencies by promoting rapid vegetative growth that dilutes available micronutrients
- F) Incorrect as primary intervention; while beneficial for soil health, compost tea won't address the immediate pH-related micronutrient lockout

Scenario: A commercial organic farm in Zone 8a is experiencing reduced yields despite adequate fertilization. Soil tests show: pH 6.2, OM 1.2%, P 45 ppm (high), K 120 ppm (adequate), Ca 800 ppm (low), Mg 200 ppm (adequate), Zn 0.5 ppm (deficient), B 0.3 ppm (adequate). The soil is sandy loam with rapid drainage.

Question: Rank these approaches from MOST to LEAST critical for immediate yield recovery:
1) Apply zinc sulfate with organic matter
2) Increase calcium through calcitic lime
3) Add compost to raise organic matter
4) Implement cover cropping with legumes

Answer: 1) Apply zinc sulfate with organic matter, 2) Add compost to raise organic matter, 3) Increase calcium through calcitic lime, 4) Implement cover cropping with legumes

Rationale:
1) Zinc deficiency at 0.5 ppm is critically low and directly impacts enzyme systems, photosynthesis, and hormone function - immediate correction is essential
2) Organic matter at 1.2% is severely inadequate for nutrient holding capacity in sandy soils - compost provides immediate CEC improvement and micronutrients
3) Calcium is low but pH is acceptable; calcitic lime would raise pH further potentially causing other issues
4) Cover cropping is excellent long-term but won't address immediate yield constraints

Scenario: A landscape contractor is working on a new development site with compacted subsoil (bulk density 1.6 g/cm³) showing signs of anaerobic conditions. The client wants to establish a native meadow without deep excavation due to budget constraints.

Question: Which TWO methods provide the most effective soil rehabilitation without deep tillage? (Select TWO)
A) Deep ripping with subsoiler to 24 inches
B) Broadcast compost at 2 inches with aeration
C) Plant daikon radish and other deep-rooted cover crops
D) Apply mycorrhizal inoculants with minimal tillage
E) Install drainage tiles with gravel backfill
F) Use solarization to reduce compaction

Answer: B, C

Rationale:
- B) Correct because 2 inches of compost provides organic matter to improve structure, while aeration creates channels for root penetration without complete disruption
- C) Correct because daikon radish can penetrate compacted soil to 24 inches, creating bio-channels that improve structure and drainage as they decompose
- A) Incorrect as it violates the "no deep excavation" budget constraint
- D) Incorrect because mycorrhizae alone cannot overcome severe physical compaction
- E) Incorrect due to budget constraints and over-engineering for meadow establishment
- F) Incorrect because solarization affects soil biology but doesn't address physical compaction

Scenario: A vineyard in Zone 7a shows variable vigor across rows despite uniform management. Soil mapping reveals three distinct areas: Area 1 - pH 5.8, high magnesium, low calcium; Area 2 - pH 7.2, adequate nutrients but poor drainage; Area 3 - pH 6.5, balanced nutrition but low organic matter (0.8%).

Question: Which management strategy addresses each area's primary limitation?
A) Area 1: Dolomitic lime, Area 2: Gypsum + drainage, Area 3: Compost + cover crops
B) Area 1: Calcitic lime, Area 2: Subsoiling, Area 3: Green manure
C) Area 1: Elemental sulfur, Area 2: Organic matter, Area 3: Fertilizer blend
D) Area 1: Calcium nitrate, Area 2: Sand incorporation, Area 3: Biochar

Answer: B) Area 1: Calcitic lime, Area 2: Subsoiling, Area 3: Green manure

Rationale:
- Area 1: Calcitic lime (CaCO₃) corrects calcium deficiency without adding more magnesium; dolomitic lime would worsen the high Mg situation
- Area 2: Physical drainage issues require subsoiling to break compaction layers before organic amendments can be effective
- Area 3: Green manure crops rapidly build organic matter and improve soil structure better than raw compost alone

Scenario: An urban garden has elevated lead levels (450 ppm) from historical contamination. The client wants to grow vegetables safely while working within budget constraints.

Question: Which THREE interventions form the most effective phytostabilization and food safety strategy? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Remove and replace 12 inches of contaminated soil
B) Build raised beds with clean soil and landscape fabric barrier
C) Plant lead-accumulating hyperaccumulators for phytoextraction
D) Add phosphate amendments to immobilize lead
E) Install drip irrigation to reduce soil splash onto edible parts
F) Focus on fruiting crops rather than leafy vegetables

Answer: B, D, F

Rationale:
- B) Correct because raised beds with barriers provide immediate safe growing space within reasonable budget
- D) Correct because phosphate amendments (rock phosphate, triple super phosphate) form stable lead-phosphate minerals reducing bioavailability
- F) Correct because fruiting crops accumulate less lead than leafy vegetables; strategic crop selection reduces exposure risk
- A) Incorrect due to excessive cost and disposal requirements for contaminated soil
- C) Incorrect because hyperaccumulators are slow, require multiple seasons, and create hazardous biomass disposal issues
- E) Incorrect as secondary measure; while helpful, doesn't address primary contamination source
