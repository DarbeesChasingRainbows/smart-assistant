Hostas, identified by large, heart-shaped leaves and tall flower spikes, thriving in shade conditions.

What is the difference between bulbs and tubers?
Bulbs are layered storage organs with fleshy scales (onions, tulips), while tubers are swollen underground stems (potatoes, dahlias).

What is the primary way to identify flowering annuals by growth habit?
Look at plant form (upright, mounding, trailing), flower shape, and leaf arrangement to determine plant type.

What is the most common perennial flower for sunny gardens?
Coneflowers (Echinacea), identified by daisy-like flowers with prominent central cones and drought tolerance.

What is the difference between ferns and flowering plants?
Ferns reproduce by spores and have fronds that unfurl from fiddleheads, while flowering plants reproduce by seeds and produce true flowers.

What is the primary characteristic of plants in the daisy family (Asteraceae)?
Composite flowers with central disk surrounded by ray flowers, including sunflowers, daisies, and many wildflowers.

What is the primary way to identify plants by their growth habit?
Observe overall form (tree, shrub, vine, perennial, annual), branching pattern, and mature size for classification.
