What is the primary purpose of Greek noun declensions in Koine?
To indicate the grammatical function of nouns through systematic case endings, allowing flexible word order while maintaining clarity.

What are the three Greek noun declensions and their basic characteristics?
First declension (alpha-declension, primarily feminine), second declension (omicron-declension, masculine/neuter), third declension (consonant-declension, all genders).

What is the difference between masculine and feminine patterns in the first declension?
Masculine first declension nouns end in -ης or -ᾱς with distinct genitive singular (-ου), while feminine nouns end in -ᾱ or -η with genitive -ης.

What is the primary purpose of Greek case endings beyond basic grammatical functions?
To express subtle relationships like time, place, manner, instrument, and association that would require prepositions in English.

What is the difference between genitive of possession and genitive of relationship in Greek?
Genitive of possession shows ownership (ἀνθρώπου = of a man), while genitive of relationship shows kinship or association (Παύλου = of Paul).

What is the primary purpose of Greek definite articles in syntax?
To specify definiteness and serve as grammatical markers indicating case, gender, and number, often appearing where English would omit articles.

What is the difference between article use with substantives and adjectives in Greek?
Articles with substantives indicate definiteness (ὁ λόγος = the word), while with adjectives they can substantivize (ὁ ἀγαθός = the good one).

What is the primary purpose of Greek adjective agreement in syntax?
To create grammatical harmony between descriptive elements and the words they modify, showing clear relationships in complex sentences.

Omega verbs follow regular patterns with predictable endings, while mu verbs often have irregular forms and reduplication in certain tenses.

What is the primary purpose of Greek verb tenses beyond simple time indication?
To express aspect (ongoing vs. completed action) and temporal relationships, with each tense having specific semantic ranges.

What is the difference between aorist and perfect tenses in Greek aspect?
Aorist tense views action as a simple completed event (ἔλυσα = I loosed), while perfect tense emphasizes present result of past action (λέλυκα = I have loosed).

What is the primary purpose of Greek verb voices in expressing agency?
To show the relationship between the subject and action, with active indicating direct agency and middle/passive showing indirect agency or reception.

What is the primary purpose of Greek participles in complex syntax?
To create adjectival verbal phrases that can modify nouns or function as subordinate clauses, adding descriptive detail to main statements.

What is the primary purpose of Greek infinitives in clause structure?
To function as verbal nouns that can serve as subjects, objects, or complements, often expressing purpose, result, or command content.

What is the primary purpose of Greek prepositions in spatial and temporal relationships?
To express precise relationships of location, direction, time, and manner that would require complex constructions in English.

Accusative prepositions often indicate motion toward or extent (εἰς, ἕως), while genitive prepositions typically show separation or origin (ἐκ, ἀπό).

What is the primary purpose of Greek conjunctions in clause connection?
To show logical relationships between clauses and sentences, indicating addition, contrast, condition, purpose, and other connections.
