// Herbalism Pediatric Clinical Scenarios & Safety Guidelines

## Pediatric Herbal Safety Guidelines

### Age-Specific Dosing Principles
**Infants (0-12 months)**: External applications only, extreme caution, pediatrician consultation required
**Toddlers (1-3 years)**: 1/4 adult dose, gentle herbs only, liquid preparations preferred
**Children (4-12 years)**: 1/3 to 1/2 adult dose based on weight, taste considerations important
**Adolescents (13-18 years)**: 3/4 adult dose, consider hormonal effects, monitor for interactions

### Critical Safety Considerations
- **Always consult pediatrician** before starting herbal treatments
- **Start low, go slow** with 1/4 recommended adult doses
- **Monitor closely** for allergic reactions and side effects
- **Avoid stimulating herbs** in children under 12 (ginseng, guarana, ephedra)
- **Use gentle preparations** (glycerites, teas, syrups) instead of strong tinctures
- **Check for contraindications** with existing medications and medical conditions

### Herbs to Avoid in Children
- **Peppermint essential oil** in infants under 2 (breathing difficulties)
- **Stimulating adaptogens** (ginseng, rhodiola) in children under 12
- **Hepatotoxic herbs** (kava, comfrey) in all pediatric populations
- **Hormone-active herbs** (black cohosh, dong quai) in adolescents without medical supervision
- **Blood-thinning herbs** (ginkgo, garlic) in children with bleeding disorders
