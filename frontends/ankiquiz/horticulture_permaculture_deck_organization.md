# Horticulture & Permaculture Flashcard Deck Organization

## Hierarchical Taxonomy Structure

### Primary Organization: Functional Domains
1. **Plant Biology & Physiology** (botany_fundamentals_*, plant_physiology_*)
2. **Soil Science & Management** (soil_science_*, soil_fertility_*)
3. **Propagation & Cultivation** (propagation_*, cultivation_*)
4. **Pest & Disease Management** (integrated_pest_management_*, plant_pathology_*)
5. **Water Management & Irrigation** (water_management_*, irrigation_systems_*)
6. **Permaculture Design Systems** (permaculture_design_*, ecological_design_*)
7. **Sustainable Agriculture** (sustainable_agriculture_*, regenerative_farming_*)
8. **Plant Identification & Taxonomy** (plant_identification_*, plant_taxonomy_*)

### Secondary Organization: Difficulty Levels
- **Fundamental** (F): Basic concepts and definitions
- **Intermediate** (I): Application and analysis
- **Expert** (E): Synthesis and clinical scenarios

### File Naming Convention

## Expert-Level Question Structure

### Clinical Vignette Format
```
Scenario: [Detailed context with environmental conditions, plant symptoms, site constraints]

Question: Which THREE interventions are most appropriate? (Select ALL that apply)
A) [Option 1]
B) [Option 2] 
C) [Option 3]
D) [Option 4]
E) [Option 5]

Answer: A, C, E

Rationale:
- A) Correct because [specific mechanism]
- B) Incorrect because [contraindication/ineffectiveness]
- C) Correct because [evidence-based reasoning]
- D) Incorrect because [adverse effects/inefficiency]
- E) Correct because [optimal outcome]
```

### Ranking Questions
```
Question: Rank these soil amendment approaches from MOST to LEAST effective for clay soil improvement in Zone 7a:

Answer: 1) Gypsum + organic matter, 2) Cover cropping with daikon radish, 3) Sand incorporation, 4) Deep tilling alone

Rationale: [Detailed explanation of each option's efficacy]
