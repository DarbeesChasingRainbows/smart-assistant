Organized by practical categories with comprehensive safety protocols, identification methods, and therapeutic applications for mycology and natural health.

## Certification Alignment
- **North American Mycological Association (NAMA)**: Complete mushroom identification and safety protocols
- **Wildcrafting/Foraging Certifications**: Edible mushroom identification and sustainable harvesting

## Safety Protocol Emphasis

### CRITICAL SAFETY FOCUS
**Mushroom identification is significantly more dangerous than plant identification** - misidentification can cause organ failure or death. This collection prioritizes safety through:
- Multiple identification features (cap, gills, stem, spore print, habitat)
- Deadly look-alike warnings for every edible species
- Emergency response procedures for poisoning incidents
- "When in doubt, throw it out" philosophy throughout

### POISONING EMERGENCY RESPONSE
- **Immediate Action**: Call poison control (1-800-222-1222) and seek medical care
- **Sample Preservation**: Keep mushroom samples for identification
- **Symptom Documentation**: Record ingestion time, amount, and symptoms
- **Medical Treatment**: Specific protocols for amatoxin vs. muscarine poisoning
