# File Organization Mapping Guide

## Recommended Approach: Virtual Organization
Instead of physically moving files (which risks breaking references), use this mapping to organize your study workflow.

## Current Flat Structure → Organized Categories

### Education & Learning (6 files)
```
Current Location → Virtual Category
├── 3rd_grade_spelling_level1.txt → Education/Spelling/3rd Grade Level 1

```

### Alternative: Create Directory Structure with Symbolic Links
If you prefer actual folders, create this structure and use symbolic links:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p "01-Education/Spelling"
mkdir -p "02-Sciences/Biology"
mkdir -p "02-Sciences/Chemistry"
mkdir -p "02-Sciences/Physics"
mkdir -p "02-Sciences/Botany"
mkdir -p "03-Healthcare/Anatomy & Physiology"
mkdir -p "03-Healthcare/First Aid"
mkdir -p "03-Healthcare/Archived"
mkdir -p "04-Cybersecurity/Fundamentals"
mkdir -p "04-Cybersecurity/Application Security"
mkdir -p "04-Cybersecurity/Security Operations"
# ... continue for all categories

# Create symbolic links (Windows example)
mklink /D "01-Education/Spelling/3rd Grade Level 1.txt" "3rd_grade_spelling_level1.txt"
mklink /D "02-Sciences/Biology/Cell Biology.txt" "basic_biology_fundamentals_cell_biology.txt"
# ... continue for all files
```

## Benefits of Virtual Organization
1. **Preserves existing references** - No broken links or paths
2. **Maintains C# project integrity** - Retention project paths remain intact
3. **Easy to implement** - Use this guide as your organizational framework
4. **Flexible** - Can be adapted without moving files
5. **Backup-friendly** - Original flat structure is easy to backup

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Study Guide Approach
Use the master index file as your organizational guide, referencing files by their current names.

### Option 2: Bookmark/Favorites Approach
Create folder bookmarks in your file explorer that point to specific file groups.

### Option 3: Symbolic Links (Advanced)
Create the directory structure with symbolic links pointing to original files.

## Recommendation
Use Option 1 (Study Guide Approach) with the master index file. It's the safest and most maintainable solution.
