// Beginner Network Security & Reconnaissance Deck

What is the primary purpose of network reconnaissance in ethical hacking?
To gather information about target networks and systems to identify potential attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and entry points before conducting security testing.

What is the difference between ping and traceroute commands?
Ping tests basic connectivity and response time to a single host, while traceroute maps the network path showing all routers between you and the target.

What is the basic command to perform a ping sweep across a network range?
"for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep 'bytes from' & done" which pings all hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network to identify live hosts.

What is the primary purpose of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) in local networks?
To map IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling communication within local network segments and useful for identifying devices on the same network.

What is the basic command to display the ARP table on a system?
"arp -a" which shows all IP-to-MAC address mappings the system has learned, useful for identifying other devices on the local network.

What is the difference between ARP scanning and ICMP scanning?
ARP scanning works within the local network segment and doesn't cross routers, while ICMP scanning can work across networks but may be blocked by firewalls.

What is the primary purpose of the "netdiscover" tool in network reconnaissance?
To perform active and passive ARP scanning to discover hosts on local networks, useful for identifying devices in your network segment.

What is the basic command to perform passive ARP discovery with netdiscover?

What is the difference between active and passive network discovery?
Active discovery sends packets to elicit responses, while passive discovery listens to existing network traffic without generating additional packets.

What is the primary purpose of port scanning in network security testing?
To identify open ports and running services on target systems, helping determine potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.

What is the basic Nmap command to scan the top 100 most common ports?
"nmap [target_ip]" which performs a quick scan of the most frequently used TCP ports on the specified target.

What is the difference between TCP connect scan and SYN scan in Nmap?
TCP connect scan completes the full three-way handshake (easier to detect), while SYN scan sends only SYN packets (stealthier and faster).

What is the primary purpose of the "-sS" flag in Nmap?
