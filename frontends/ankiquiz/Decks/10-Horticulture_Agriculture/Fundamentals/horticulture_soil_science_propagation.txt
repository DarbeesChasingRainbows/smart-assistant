// Horticulture Soil Science & Plant Propagation Deck

What is the primary composition of soil?
Minerals (sand, silt, clay), organic matter, water, and air.

What are the three main soil particles by size, from largest to smallest?
Sand (largest), Silt (medium), Clay (smallest).

What is "soil texture"?
The relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay in a soil, which determine its feel and physical properties.

What is "soil structure"?
The arrangement of soil particles into aggregates or clumps (peds), affecting pore space and water movement.

What is "cation exchange capacity" (CEC)?
A measure of the soil's ability to hold and exchange positively charged nutrient ions (cations) like calcium, magnesium, and potassium; higher CEC indicates higher fertility potential.

What is the optimal pH range for most vegetable crops?
6.0 to 7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral).

What happens to nutrient availability in highly acidic soil (low pH)?
Macronutrients (N, P, K) become less available, while some micronutrients (like Aluminum and Manganese) can become toxic.

What happens to nutrient availability in highly alkaline soil (high pH)?
Micronutrients like Iron, Manganese, and Zinc often become unavailable, leading to deficiencies (e.g., chlorosis).

What is "chlorosis" in plants?
Yellowing of leaf tissue due to a lack of chlorophyll, often caused by nutrient deficiency (often Iron or Nitrogen) or high pH.

What is the purpose of adding agricultural lime to soil?
To raise the pH (reduce acidity) and provide calcium (and magnesium if using dolomitic lime).

What is the purpose of adding elemental sulfur to soil?
To lower the pH (increase acidity) over time as bacteria convert it to sulfuric acid.

What is the "Soil Food Web"?
The community of organisms living all or part of their lives in the soil, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, earthworms, and arthropods.

What is the primary function of mycorrhizal fungi?
They form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, extending the root system's reach to absorb water and nutrients (especially Phosphorus) in exchange for sugars.

What is the difference between "aerobic" and "anaerobic" composting?
Aerobic composting uses oxygen-loving bacteria (requires turning/air) and is generally faster/hotter; anaerobic lacks oxygen (e.g., bokashi) and can be smelly/slower but conserves more mass.

What is the C:N ratio in composting?
The ratio of Carbon (browns) to Nitrogen (greens); the ideal ratio for rapid decomposition is approximately 30:1.

Purple or reddish discoloration on leaves, stunted growth, and poor root/fruit development.

What are the symptoms of Potassium deficiency?
Scorched or browning edges on older leaves, weak stems, and poor fruit quality.

What are the symptoms of Calcium deficiency?
Blossom end rot in tomatoes/peppers and distorted new growth (immobile nutrient).

What is an "F1 Hybrid"?
The first generation offspring of two distinct, true-breeding parent lines; often exhibits "hybrid vigor" but seeds do not breed true.

What is an "open-pollinated" variety?
A variety that breeds true to type when pollinated by itself or another plant of the same variety.

What is an "heirloom" variety?
An open-pollinated variety that has been passed down for generations (usually 50+ years) and is valued for flavor/history.

What is "seed saving"?
Collecting and storing seeds from mature plants for future planting; requires knowledge of isolation distances to prevent cross-pollination.

What is "dry processing" of seeds?
Allowing seeds to dry on the plant (e.g., beans, corn) before harvesting and threshing.
