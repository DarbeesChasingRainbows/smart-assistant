// Horticulture Fundamentals & Permaculture Principles Deck

What is the primary definition of horticulture?
The branch of agriculture concerned with the intensive cultivation of plants for food, medicine, and aesthetic purposes, including fruits, vegetables, ornamentals, and herbs.

What is the primary definition of permaculture?
A holistic design system based on ethical principles and patterns found in nature to create sustainable, agriculturally productive, and resilient human environments.

What are the three core ethics of permaculture?
Earth Care (rebuilding natural capital), People Care (nurturing self, kin, and community), and Fair Share (setting limits to consumption and redistribution of surplus).

What is the difference between monoculture and polyculture?
Monoculture grows a single crop species in a given area, while polyculture grows multiple species together to increase diversity and resilience.

What is the "Principle of Interaction" in permaculture?
"Observe and Interact": By taking time to engage with nature, we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.

What is the "Principle of Energy" in permaculture?
"Catch and Store Energy": Developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant to use them in times of need (e.g., solar, water, biomass).

What is the primary purpose of a "Guild" in permaculture design?
A grouping of plants, animals, and other elements that work together to support each other, such as a central fruit tree surrounded by nitrogen fixers and accumulators.

What is the difference between an annual and a perennial plant?
Annuals complete their life cycle in one growing season, while perennials live for more than two years, often providing ongoing harvests.

What is the "Principle of Yield" in permaculture?
"Obtain a Yield": Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing (food, fiber, energy, etc.).

What is the "Principle of Feedback" in permaculture?
"Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback": Discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.

What is the definition of "hardiness zone" in horticulture?
A geographic area defined to encompass a certain range of climatic conditions (usually minimum temperature) relevant to plant survival.

What is the difference between organic and conventional horticulture?
Organic horticulture relies on natural ecosystem management and inputs (compost, biological pest control) rather than synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

What is the "Principle of Renewables" in permaculture?
"Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services": Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.

What is the primary purpose of "zoning" in permaculture design?
To organize elements based on the frequency of human use and plant needs, placing high-maintenance/frequent-visit elements (Zone 1) closest to the center of activity.

"Integrate Rather than Segregate": Putting the right things in the right place so relationships develop between them and they work together.

What is the difference between an heirloom and a hybrid plant variety?
Heirlooms are open-pollinated varieties passed down through generations, while hybrids are created by crossing two different parent varieties and may not breed true.
