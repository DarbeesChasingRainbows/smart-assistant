// Integrated Pest Management Intermediate - Basic Strategies & Common Pests

What is the primary difference between pests and beneficial insects?
Pests cause damage to plants, while beneficial insects help control pests or provide pollination services.

What is the most important first step in any pest management program?
Correct identification of the pest species, as different pests require different management approaches.

What is the difference between cultural and mechanical pest control?
Cultural controls modify growing conditions to prevent problems, while mechanical controls physically remove or block pests.

What is the primary purpose of integrated pest management (IPM)?
To use multiple control methods in an environmentally and economically sound way, minimizing pesticide use while managing pests effectively.

What is the most common garden pest that causes holes in leaves?
Chewing insects like caterpillars, beetles, or grasshoppers - identification determines specific control method.

What is the difference between complete and incomplete metamorphosis?
Complete metamorphosis has four stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult), while incomplete has three stages (egg, nymph, adult).

What is the primary benefit of companion planting for pest management?
Some plants repel pests, attract beneficial insects, or confuse pest insects through scent or visual disruption.

What is the most effective way to prevent aphid infestations?
Monitor plants regularly, encourage beneficial insects, and use strong water sprays to remove early infestations.

What is the difference between systemic and contact pesticides?
Systemic pesticides are absorbed into plant tissue, while contact pesticides must directly touch the pest to be effective.

What is the primary cause of increased pest problems in stressed plants?
Stressed plants produce fewer defensive compounds and emit stress signals that attract pest insects.

What is the most common beneficial insect for garden pest control?
Lady beetles (ladybugs) that consume aphids, mealybugs, and other soft-bodied insects throughout their life cycle.

What is the difference between selective and broad-spectrum pesticides?
Selective pesticides target specific pest types while sparing beneficials, while broad-spectrum pesticides kill most insects they contact.

What is the primary purpose of crop rotation in pest management?
Breaks pest life cycles by removing host plants, reducing soil-borne pest populations, and improves soil health.

What is the most effective way to control slugs and snails organically?
Hand picking, beer traps, copper barriers, and encouraging natural predators like birds and ground beetles.

What is the difference between monitoring and scouting in IPM?
Monitoring uses traps and regular checks to track pest populations, while scouting involves actively searching for pests in specific areas.

What is the primary benefit of using row covers in vegetable gardens?
Physical barrier prevents insect pests from reaching plants while allowing light and water to penetrate.

What is the most common sign of spider mite infestation?
Fine webbing on plants and tiny moving dots on leaf undersides, often with yellow stippling on upper leaf surfaces.

What is the difference between predatory and parasitic beneficial insects?
Predators directly consume prey, while parasites lay eggs in or on pests, with larvae killing the host as they develop.

What is the primary purpose of beneficial insect release programs?
Supplement natural populations and provide immediate biological control when pest pressure exceeds natural predator capacity.

What is the most effective way to prevent indoor plant pests?
Quarantine new plants, inspect regularly, maintain proper humidity, and avoid overfertilizing which promotes soft growth.

What is the difference between life cycle timing and degree days in pest management?
Life cycle timing uses calendar dates, while degree days measure heat accumulation to predict pest development more accurately.

What is the primary cause of pesticide resistance in pest populations?
Repeated use of same pesticide mode of action allows resistant individuals to survive and reproduce.

What is the most common method for monitoring flying insect pests?
Yellow sticky traps for flying insects, pheromone traps for specific species, and light traps for night-flying insects.

What is the difference between economic threshold and action level in IPM?
Economic threshold is pest level where control becomes economically justified, while action level is when control measures should be implemented.

What is the primary benefit of maintaining plant diversity in gardens?
Provides habitat for beneficial insects, reduces pest outbreaks through natural balance, and creates more resilient ecosystem.

What is the most effective way to control squash bugs organically?
Hand picking, removing eggs masses, using row covers early, and planting resistant varieties.

What is the difference between contact stomach poisons and growth regulators?
Contact stomach poisons must be eaten to work, while insect growth regulators disrupt development and prevent maturation.

What is the primary purpose of sanitation in garden pest management?
Remove pest habitat, eliminate overwintering sites, and reduce disease spread by cleaning up plant debris and weeds.

What is the most common indoor plant pest?
Spider mites, aphids, mealybugs, and fungus gnats - each requires specific identification and control methods.

What is the difference between repellent and antifeedant pest control products?
Repellents drive pests away from plants, while antifeedants make plants unpalatable after pests begin feeding.

This intermediate IPM deck provides practical knowledge for identifying and managing common garden pests using integrated, environmentally responsible approaches.
