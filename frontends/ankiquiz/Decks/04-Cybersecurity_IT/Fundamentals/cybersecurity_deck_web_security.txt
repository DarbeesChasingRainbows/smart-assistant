Weak random number generation or predictable initialization vectors allowing cryptographic attacks and key recovery.

When implementing secure password storage, what is the most effective approach beyond basic hashing?
Using memory-hard functions like Argon2 or scrypt with proper salt generation, pepper implementation, and regular hashing algorithm updates.

Disabling DTD processing entirely, using secure XML parsers with external entity resolution disabled, and implementing strict input validation.

In the context of security headers, what is the most critical implementation that developers commonly miss?
Proper Content Security Policy implementation without unsafe directives combined with comprehensive security header configuration.

What is the most effective method to prevent template injection attacks in modern web applications?
Using sandboxed template engines with strict context isolation and proper input sanitization combined with comprehensive output encoding.

In the context of secure file handling, what is the most critical vulnerability that attackers exploit?
Path traversal vulnerabilities allowing directory traversal and access to unauthorized files outside intended directories.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing secure authentication in microservices?
Implementing centralized authentication with proper token validation, service-to-service authentication, and comprehensive audit logging.

When implementing secure error handling, what is the most effective approach to prevent information disclosure?
Generic error messages for users with detailed logging for administrators combined with proper exception handling and security monitoring.

What is the most effective method to prevent insecure direct object references (IDOR) in modern applications?
Implementing proper access control checks with authorization validation and indirect object references combined with comprehensive security testing.

In the context of secure API security, what is the most critical implementation that developers commonly miss?
Proper rate limiting with anomaly detection and comprehensive input validation combined with authentication and authorization enforcement.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing secure session management in distributed systems?
Centralized session storage with proper synchronization, secure session identifiers, and comprehensive session lifecycle management.

When implementing secure web sockets, what is the most effective method to prevent attacks?
