// Web Security Intermediate - Application Defense & Vulnerability Assessment

What is the primary difference between XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?
XSS executes malicious scripts in the victim's browser to steal data or perform actions, while CSRF tricks the victim into performing actions they didn't intend on a website where they're authenticated.

What is the most effective method to prevent SQL injection attacks?
Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) with proper input validation and least privilege database access to prevent malicious SQL code execution.

What is the primary purpose of Content Security Policy (CSP) in web security?
To prevent XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources (scripts, styles, images) are allowed to load, reducing the attack surface for code injection.

What is the difference between authentication and authorization in web applications?
Authentication verifies who the user is (identity), while authorization determines what the user is allowed to do (permissions) after authentication.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing file upload functionality?
Validate file content using magic bytes rather than extensions, store files outside web root, implement size limits, and scan for malware before processing.

What is the primary purpose of OWASP Top 10 in web security?
To provide awareness and guidance on the most critical web application security risks, helping developers prioritize security efforts effectively.

What is the difference between stored XSS and reflected XSS?
Stored XSS persists malicious scripts in the database or files affecting multiple users, while reflected XSS reflects malicious scripts in immediate responses affecting individual users.

What is the most effective method to prevent session hijacking attacks?
Implement secure session management with HTTPS-only cookies, proper session timeout, regeneration on privilege changes, and secure random session IDs.

What is the primary security benefit of implementing HTTPS (TLS/SSL)?
Encrypts data in transit between client and server, preventing eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

What is the difference between black-box and white-box web application security testing?
Black-box testing examines applications from external perspective without knowledge of internal structure, while white-box testing has full access to source code and architecture.

What is the most critical consideration when implementing API security?
Use proper authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT), implement rate limiting, validate all inputs, and use HTTPS to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access.

What is the primary purpose of input validation in web security?
To prevent injection attacks by ensuring user input conforms to expected format, length, and character sets before processing by the application.

What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in web applications?
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption/decryption (faster), while asymmetric uses public/private key pairs (slower but enables secure key exchange).

What is the most effective method to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks?
Implement output encoding based on context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS), use CSP headers, validate inputs, and use safe frameworks that auto-escape content.

What is the primary security consideration for cookie management?
Set Secure and HttpOnly flags, implement proper expiration, use SameSite attribute, and avoid storing sensitive information in cookies.

What is the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing for web applications?
Vulnerability scanning automatically identifies known vulnerabilities, while penetration testing actively exploits vulnerabilities to assess real-world impact.

What is the most critical security consideration when implementing user authentication?
Use strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, secure password storage (bcrypt/scrypt), and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks.

What is the primary purpose of security headers in web applications?
To provide additional layers of protection by instructing browsers on security policies like XSS protection, clickjacking prevention, and content type restrictions.

What is the difference between server-side and client-side security controls?
Server-side controls enforce security rules on the server, while client-side controls provide additional protection in the browser but can be bypassed by attackers.

What is the most effective method to prevent insecure direct object references (IDOR)?
Implement proper authorization checks for every object access, use indirect references, and validate user permissions before allowing data access.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing third-party integrations?
Validate all data from external sources, implement proper authentication, use HTTPS for all communications, and monitor for unusual activity from integrated services.

What is the difference between business logic flaws and technical vulnerabilities?
Business logic flaws exploit application workflow and design weaknesses, while technical vulnerabilities exploit implementation errors in code or configuration.

What is the most effective method to prevent clickjacking attacks?
Implement X-Frame-Options headers, use Content Security Policy with frame-ancestors directive, and JavaScript frame-busting techniques.

What is the primary security consideration for error handling in web applications?
Display generic error messages to users while logging detailed errors for analysis, preventing information disclosure that could aid attackers.

What is the difference between white-box and black-box input validation?
White-box validation uses knowledge of application internals to create comprehensive validation rules, while black-box validation tests inputs without internal knowledge.

What is the most effective method to prevent insecure deserialization attacks?
Avoid deserializing untrusted data, use safe serialization formats (JSON), implement integrity checks, and validate all serialized data before processing.

What is the primary security consideration for web application firewalls (WAF)?
Properly configure rules for specific application rather than using default settings, regularly update signatures, and monitor for false positives/negatives.

What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous security testing?
Synchronous testing provides immediate results but may miss time-based vulnerabilities, while asynchronous testing can detect timing attacks and race conditions.

What is the most effective method to prevent HTTP parameter pollution?
Validate parameter names and values, use strict parameter parsing, implement parameter whitelisting, and normalize input before processing.

What is the primary security consideration when implementing REST APIs?
Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), implement authentication/authorization, validate all inputs, and use rate limiting to prevent abuse.

This intermediate web security deck provides essential knowledge for identifying, preventing, and testing common web application vulnerabilities with practical defense strategies.
