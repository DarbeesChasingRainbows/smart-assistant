D) Pass-the-hash using Mimikatz with captured NTLM hashes
E) Golden ticket creation using krbtgt account compromise
F) WMI lateral movement using PowerShell remoting

Answer: A, B, F

Rationale:
- A) Correct because Kerberoasting extracts service tickets offline without triggering immediate alerts, providing credential harvesting opportunities
- B) Correct because DCOM/WinRM uses legitimate administrative protocols with minimal logging compared to SMB exploitation
- F) Correct because WMI PowerShell remoting leverages native Windows management tools with operational cover
- C) Incorrect SMB relay attacks generate network noise and are easily detected by modern security monitoring
- D) Incorrect pass-the-hash requires direct memory access which triggers endpoint detection and response alerts
- E) Incorrect golden ticket creation requires domain controller compromise, which is high-impact and easily detected

Scenario: A web application penetration test targets a custom e-commerce platform with user authentication, payment processing, and administrative interfaces. The application uses modern JavaScript frameworks, REST APIs, and third-party payment integrations.

Question: Which THREE vulnerability assessment techniques provide the highest impact findings for this type of application? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Business logic flaw testing for cart manipulation and pricing bypasses
B) API security testing including authentication bypass and rate limiting
C) Client-side JavaScript testing for DOM-based XSS and sensitive data exposure
D) Traditional SQL injection testing on login and search functions
E) Cross-site request forgery testing on administrative functions
F) Server-side template injection testing on dynamic content generation

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because business logic flaws often bypass traditional security controls and can lead to significant financial impact
- B) Correct because modern applications rely heavily on APIs which frequently have authentication and authorization vulnerabilities
- C) Correct because client-side JavaScript vulnerabilities can bypass server-side controls and expose sensitive user data
- D) Incorrect while SQL injection remains important, modern frameworks often provide built-in protection reducing prevalence
- E) Incorrect CSRF is well-understood and most frameworks provide built-in protection, making it lower impact than other issues
- F) Incorrect template injection is rare in production applications compared to other vulnerability types

Scenario: A cloud security assessment targets an AWS environment with multiple accounts, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and RDS databases. The engagement focuses on misconfigurations, data exposure, and privilege escalation opportunities.

Question: Which THREE cloud security assessment techniques provide the most critical findings? (Select ALL that apply)
A) S3 bucket enumeration for public access and sensitive data exposure
B) IAM role trust relationship analysis for cross-account privilege escalation
C) Lambda function environment variable and IAM permission enumeration
D) Security group and NACL configuration review for network exposure
E) CloudTrail logging analysis for detection bypass opportunities
F) RDS database backup and snapshot security assessment

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because public S3 buckets frequently expose sensitive data and are easily discoverable through enumeration
- B) Correct because IAM trust relationships often provide cross-account access paths that bypass traditional security controls
- C) Correct because Lambda functions frequently contain credentials in environment variables and excessive IAM permissions
- D) Incorrect network misconfigurations are important but typically provide lower impact than data exposure and privilege escalation
- E) Incorrect logging gaps are important for detection but don't provide direct compromise opportunities
- F) Incorrect database backup security is critical but often properly configured compared to other cloud services

Scenario: A physical security assessment targets a corporate campus with multiple buildings, access control systems, and data centers. The engagement tests physical access controls, surveillance systems, and security awareness.

Question: Which THREE physical security testing techniques provide the most realistic threat simulation? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Tailgating attempts through secure entrances during shift changes
B) Badge cloning and access control system testing
C) Social engineering attempts for facility access and information gathering
D) Wireless network access from parking areas and public spaces
E) Dumpster diving for sensitive information and access credentials
F) Lock picking and physical barrier testing for data center access

Answer: A, C, D

Rationale:
- A) Correct because tailgading is the most common physical security breach and tests employee awareness and access control effectiveness
- C) Correct because social engineering exploits human factors which are often the weakest link in physical security
- D) Correct because wireless access from external areas can bypass physical controls entirely and provides network entry points
- B) Incorrect badge cloning requires specialized equipment and may not represent common threat actor capabilities
- E) Incorrect while dumpster diving can yield information, modern document destruction policies reduce effectiveness
- F) Incorrect lock picking requires significant skill and may trigger immediate security response, making it less realistic

Scenario: A social engineering assessment targets employee susceptibility through phishing, vishing, and physical pretexting. The engagement focuses on technical controls, user awareness, and incident response capabilities.

Question: Which THREE social engineering techniques provide the most comprehensive assessment of organizational resilience? (Select ALL that apply)
