- C) Correct because human validation combines automated detection speed with analytical accuracy
- F) Correct because optimized features improve detection accuracy and reduce noise in ML models
- D) Incorrect high sensitivity without proper filtering creates alert fatigue and reduces effectiveness
- E) Incorrect while important for response, automated integration doesn't improve detection capabilities

Scenario: A security operations center implements deception technology (honeypots, honeytokens, honey networks) to enhance threat hunting capabilities. The team needs to develop hunting methodologies that leverage deception for attacker engagement, intelligence gathering, and early warning of sophisticated attacks.

Question: Which FOUR deception-enhanced threat hunting techniques provide the most comprehensive attacker intelligence and early warning? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Honeytoken deployment in high-value locations for immediate compromise detection
B) Interactive honeypots designed to engage attackers and collect detailed TTP information

Rationale:
- A) Correct because honeytokens in critical locations provide immediate alerts when attackers access sensitive assets
- B) Correct because interactive honeypots engage attackers and provide detailed methodology and tool analysis
- C) Correct because network deception detects lateral movement and provides early warning of network traversal
- F) Correct because SIEM integration correlates deception alerts with broader security context for comprehensive analysis
- D) Incorrect while valuable for intelligence, passive deception doesn't provide the detailed engagement of interactive techniques
- E) Incorrect application deception requires significant maintenance and may generate high false positive rates

Scenario: A security team implements proactive threat hunting for emerging threats and zero-day vulnerabilities. The organization needs methodologies for detecting novel attack techniques before they're widely understood and traditional signatures are available.

Question: Which FOUR emerging threat hunting techniques provide the most effective detection of novel attack methodologies? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Behavioral anomaly hunting focusing on deviations from established normal patterns
B) Threat intelligence-driven hunting based on early warning indicators and industry sharing
C) Protocol and application layer analysis for unusual communication patterns

E) Traditional signature-based hunting updated with latest threat feeds
F) Asset-specific hunting focusing on systems likely to be targeted by emerging threats

Answer: A, B, C, F

Rationale:
- A) Correct because behavioral anomalies often indicate novel attack techniques before specific signatures exist
- B) Correct because early threat intelligence provides indicators of emerging attacks before widespread deployment
- C) Correct because protocol analysis can detect unusual attack patterns that bypass traditional detection
