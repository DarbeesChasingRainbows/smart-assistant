// Application Security Expert - Advanced Vulnerabilities & Sophisticated Attacks

Scenario: A financial services application implements microservices architecture with complex API interactions, OAuth 2.0 authentication, and JWT token management. The security assessment needs to identify sophisticated authentication bypass, authorization flaws, and business logic vulnerabilities across the service mesh.

Question: Which THREE advanced application security testing techniques provide the highest impact findings for microservices authentication and authorization? (Select ALL that apply)
A) JWT token manipulation and algorithm confusion attack testing
B) Service-to-service authentication bypass and trust relationship exploitation
C) API gateway rate limiting and authorization bypass testing
D) Business logic flaw testing for transaction manipulation and privilege escalation
E) Traditional SQL injection and XSS vulnerability assessment
F) Container security and orchestration platform vulnerability analysis

Answer: A, B, D

Rationale:
- A) Correct because JWT algorithm confusion attacks can bypass authentication entirely and are frequently missed in standard testing
- B) Correct because service-to-service trust relationships often provide lateral movement paths within microservices architectures
- D) Correct because business logic flaws in financial applications can lead to significant financial impact and regulatory violations
- C) Incorrect while API gateway security is important, it's typically well-configured and represents lower impact than other issues
- E) Incorrect traditional web vulnerabilities are less prevalent in modern microservices with built-in framework protections
- F) Incorrect container security is important infrastructure but doesn't represent application-level vulnerabilities

Scenario: A modern web application implements server-side rendering with React, GraphQL APIs, and real-time WebSocket communications. The application handles sensitive user data and implements complex client-side state management with sophisticated caching strategies.

- B) Correct because GraphQL authorization bypasses can expose unauthorized data access across complex query structures
- C) Correct because WebSocket vulnerabilities are frequently overlooked and can provide real-time data exfiltration paths
- D) Incorrect while still relevant, traditional XSS/CSRF are well-understood and often mitigated by modern frameworks
- E) Incorrect template injection is less common in modern applications compared to other vulnerability types
- F) Incorrect CSP bypasses are important but typically provide lower impact than other advanced vulnerabilities

Scenario: A mobile application implements native iOS and Android clients with REST API backend, biometric authentication, and local data storage. The security assessment needs to identify sophisticated mobile-specific vulnerabilities including reverse engineering, data protection, and API security.

Question: Which THREE mobile application security testing techniques provide the most critical findings for modern mobile applications? (Select ALL that apply)

D) Network traffic analysis and certificate pinning bypass testing
E) Mobile device specific vulnerabilities and OS exploitation testing
F) Traditional web application vulnerability assessment on mobile APIs

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because reverse engineering can expose sensitive algorithms, API keys, and business logic
- B) Correct because local data storage weaknesses frequently lead to credential and sensitive data exposure
- C) Correct because mobile API security is often neglected and provides direct access to backend systems
- D) Incorrect while important for man-in-the-middle protection, certificate pinning bypasses represent lower impact than other issues
- E) Incorrect OS exploitation is important but represents platform security rather than application security
- F) Incorrect traditional web vulnerabilities are less prevalent in mobile-specific API implementations

Scenario: An enterprise application implements complex workflow automation with business process management, user role management, and multi-level approval systems. The application handles sensitive business data and implements sophisticated access control with dynamic permission evaluation.

Question: Which THREE business logic and authorization testing techniques provide the highest impact findings for workflow applications? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Authorization bypass testing for workflow manipulation and privilege escalation
B) Business logic flaw testing for financial transaction manipulation
C) Race condition and concurrency vulnerability assessment in approval processes
D) Traditional input validation and output encoding vulnerability testing
E) Session management and authentication bypass vulnerability assessment
F) Database security and SQL injection vulnerability testing

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because authorization bypasses in workflow systems can lead to significant business process manipulation
- B) Correct because business logic flaws in financial workflows can result in direct financial loss and regulatory violations
- C) Correct because race conditions in approval processes can bypass security controls and authorize invalid transactions
- D) Incorrect while important, input validation represents foundational security rather than advanced business logic vulnerabilities
- E) Incorrect session management is typically well-implemented in enterprise applications and represents lower impact
- F) Incorrect SQL injection is less prevalent in modern enterprise applications with built-in protections

Scenario: A DevOps environment implements continuous integration/deployment with infrastructure as code, automated testing, and container orchestration. The security assessment needs to identify sophisticated supply chain vulnerabilities, pipeline abuses, and deployment-time attacks.

Question: Which THREE DevOps security assessment techniques provide the most critical findings for modern CI/CD pipelines? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Supply chain vulnerability analysis and dependency security assessment
B) Pipeline credential abuse and secret management security testing
C) Infrastructure as code template security and misconfiguration analysis
D) Container image security and runtime vulnerability assessment
E) Traditional application security testing in pipeline integration
F) Network security and firewall configuration assessment

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because supply chain vulnerabilities represent the most critical attack vector in modern DevOps environments
- B) Correct because pipeline credentials provide extensive access and are frequently exposed or misconfigured
- C) Correct because IaC misconfigurations can create widespread security issues across deployed infrastructure
- D) Incorrect while important, container security represents runtime protection rather than pipeline-specific vulnerabilities
- E) Incorrect traditional application testing is important but doesn't address pipeline-specific attack vectors
- F) Incorrect network security is important infrastructure but doesn't represent DevOps-specific vulnerabilities

Scenario: An API-first application implements RESTful services with OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and complex rate limiting. The application serves mobile clients, web applications, and third-party integrations with sophisticated API key management and versioning.
