Scenario: A security operations center (SOC) detects unusual authentication patterns across the enterprise network. Multiple user accounts show login attempts from geographically impossible locations within minutes of each other. The security team needs to determine if this indicates credential stuffing, password spraying, or a more sophisticated attack.

Question: Which THREE detection and response actions provide the most effective immediate containment while preserving forensic evidence? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Implement geolocation-based conditional access policies immediately
B) Enforce multi-factor authentication requirements for all affected accounts
C) Create hunting queries to identify lateral movement from compromised accounts
D) Force password reset for all accounts showing anomalous authentication
E) Deploy deception credentials (honeytokens) to track attacker activity
F) Isolate affected systems from network to prevent further compromise

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because conditional access policies immediately block suspicious geographic locations while allowing legitimate access
- B) Correct because MFA prevents credential reuse attacks even if valid credentials are compromised
- C) Correct because hunting queries identify attacker TTPs and potential lateral movement before they cause additional damage
- D) Incorrect while password resets are important, they alert attackers and may cause them to escalate to more destructive techniques
- E) Incorrect honeytokens are valuable for intelligence but don't provide immediate protection for active attacks
- F) Incorrect system isolation is too disruptive for authentication-based attacks and impacts business operations

Scenario: A financial services organization experiences a sophisticated ransomware attack that encrypts critical database servers. The attack shows signs of double extortion with data exfiltration threats. Incident response needs to balance containment, recovery, and evidence preservation.

Question: Which THREE incident response priorities provide the optimal balance between operational continuity and forensic investigation? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Isolate affected network segments to prevent propagation while preserving logs
B) Implement network segmentation and traffic monitoring for C2 communication
C) Create forensic images of affected systems before recovery operations
D) Pay ransom to decrypt data and prevent public disclosure
E) Engage law enforcement and cyber insurance providers immediately
F) Restore from backups while maintaining monitoring for reinfection

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because targeted isolation prevents spread while maintaining evidence collection capabilities
- B) Correct because segmentation and monitoring identify ongoing attacker activity and communications
- C) Correct because forensic images preserve evidence for investigation while allowing recovery operations to proceed
- D) Incorrect paying ransom encourages criminal activity and doesn't guarantee data recovery or non-disclosure
- E) Incorrect while important for long-term response, these activities don't provide immediate technical containment
- F) Incorrect restoration before containment may result in immediate reinfection and data loss

Scenario: A cloud security team detects unusual API activity in their AWS environment. Multiple IAM roles show privilege escalation attempts through trust relationship modifications. The team needs to determine if this indicates a compromised account, misconfiguration, or sophisticated cloud attack.

Question: Which THREE cloud security investigation techniques provide the most comprehensive attack reconstruction? (Select ALL that apply)
A) CloudTrail log analysis for IAM role creation and modification events
B) VPC flow logs analysis to identify source IP addresses and traffic patterns
C) GuardDuty findings correlation for threat intelligence and behavioral analysis
D) Config rules evaluation for compliance drift and security posture changes
E) S3 access log analysis for data exfiltration attempts
F) CloudWatch metrics analysis for performance anomalies and resource usage

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because CloudTrail provides complete audit trail of all API actions and permission changes
- B) Correct because VPC flow logs identify network sources, destinations, and communication patterns
- C) Correct because GuardDuty provides threat intelligence and behavioral analysis for sophisticated attack detection
- D) Incorrect while important for compliance, config rules don't provide attack reconstruction capabilities
- E) Incorrect S3 access logs are valuable but represent only one aspect of the attack surface
- F) Incorrect performance metrics don't typically provide security-relevant attack information

Scenario: A security monitoring team implements machine learning-based anomaly detection for user behavior analytics. The system generates numerous false positives for legitimate administrative activities, causing alert fatigue and reduced effectiveness. The team needs to optimize detection accuracy while maintaining security coverage.

Question: Which THREE optimization strategies provide the most effective balance between detection accuracy and operational efficiency? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Implement risk-based scoring with contextual awareness and business criticality
B) Create whitelist exceptions for known legitimate administrative patterns
C) Develop adaptive baselines that learn from legitimate user behavior over time
D) Reduce detection sensitivity to eliminate false positives
E) Implement multi-layered validation with human analyst confirmation
F) Focus on high-impact indicators rather than behavioral anomalies

Answer: A, C, E

Rationale:
- A) Correct because risk-based scoring prioritizes alerts based on actual threat potential and business impact
- C) Correct because adaptive baselines learn normal patterns and reduce false positives while maintaining detection capability
- E) Correct because multi-layered validation combines automated detection with human expertise for optimal accuracy
- B) Incorrect while exceptions reduce false positives, they create blind spots that attackers can exploit
- D) Incorrect reducing sensitivity may miss actual attacks and create security gaps
- F) Incorrect focusing only on high-impact indicators misses sophisticated low-and-slow attacks

Scenario: A security operations center implements threat hunting capabilities to proactively identify attacker presence. The team has basic SIEM tools but needs to develop effective hunting methodologies and techniques to complement automated detection.

Question: Which THREE threat hunting approaches provide the highest return on investment for detecting sophisticated attacks? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Hypothesis-driven hunting based on threat intelligence and attack frameworks
B) Anomaly hunting focusing on unusual process execution and network connections
C) Timeline analysis of privileged account activity and administrative actions
D) Signature-based hunting for known malware and attack patterns
E) Environmental hunting for misconfigurations and security control gaps
F) Asset-based hunting focusing on critical systems and high-value targets

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because hypothesis-driven hunting targets specific TTPs based on current threats and attack methodologies
- B) Correct because anomaly hunting identifies novel attacks and sophisticated techniques that evade signature-based detection
- C) Correct because timeline analysis of privileged accounts often reveals attacker activity and lateral movement patterns
- D) Incorrect signature-based hunting is already handled by automated security tools and provides limited additional value
- E) Incorrect while important for security posture, misconfiguration hunting doesn't typically detect active attacker presence
- F) Incorrect asset-based hunting is too narrow and may miss attacks that traverse multiple systems

Scenario: A security team implements deception technology (honeypots, honeytokens) to detect attacker activity and gather intelligence. The deployment needs to balance detection capabilities, operational overhead, and false positive management while providing actionable threat intelligence.

Question: Which THREE deception technology strategies provide the most effective detection and intelligence gathering? (Select ALL that apply)
A) Deploy honeytokens in high-value locations like databases and cloud storage
B) Create realistic honeypot environments that mirror production systems
C) Implement network deception with fake services and credentials
D) Use deception for user awareness training and phishing simulation
E) Deploy application-level deception with fake APIs and web services
F) Focus deception efforts on perimeter detection rather than internal networks

Answer: A, B, C

Rationale:
- A) Correct because honeytokens in high-value locations provide immediate alerts when attackers access sensitive data
- B) Correct because realistic honeypots engage attackers and provide detailed TTP information and tool analysis
- C) Correct because network deception detects lateral movement and provides early warning of network traversal
- D) Incorrect while valuable for training, user deception doesn't provide threat intelligence or attack detection
- E) Incorrect application deception requires significant maintenance and may generate high false positive rates
- F) Incorrect focusing only on perimeter deception misses internal attacker activity and lateral movement
