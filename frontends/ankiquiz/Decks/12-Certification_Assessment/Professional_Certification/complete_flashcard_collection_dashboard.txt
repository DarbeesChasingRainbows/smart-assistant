## Strategic Development Priorities

### HIGH PRIORITY 🚀
**Circuit Analysis** - Technical certification alignment with PE/EE exams
- **ROI**: High professional value, clear certification pathways
- **Effort**: 5 existing decks suggest partial coverage exists
- **Strategy**: Complete three-tier progression similar to technical collections

### MEDIUM PRIORITY 📈
**Basic Sciences Enhancement** (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
- **ROI**: Academic foundation with practical applications
- **Effort**: 4 decks each suggest good foundational coverage
- **Strategy**: Intermediate level enhancement for practical laboratory applications

### LOW PRIORITY 🔍
**Specialized Subjects Organization** (Biblical studies, spelling, botany)
- **ROI**: Niche audiences with limited certification pathways
- **Effort**: Primarily organization rather than new content
- **Strategy**: Create master indices and cross-references
