What is the primary purpose of molecular phylogenetics in angiosperm classification?
To use DNA sequence data to reconstruct evolutionary relationships, providing objective evidence for taxonomic decisions and revealing hidden evolutionary patterns.

What is the difference between chloroplast and nuclear DNA markers in angiosperm phylogeny?
Chloroplast markers like matK and rbcL evolve slowly and track deep evolutionary history, while nuclear markers like ITS evolve faster and resolve recent relationships.

What is the primary purpose of genome sequencing in modern angiosperm taxonomy?
To provide comprehensive genetic data for understanding evolutionary relationships, species boundaries, and adaptive evolution across flowering plant diversity.

What is the difference between whole-genome and target-enrichment sequencing in plant phylogenetics?
Whole-genome sequencing provides complete genetic information but is expensive, while target-enrichment focuses on specific genes for cost-effective phylogenetic analysis.

What is the primary purpose of morphological characters in angiosperm classification?
To provide observable characteristics for identification and phylogenetic analysis, complementing molecular data and revealing adaptive evolution patterns.

What is the difference between vegetative and reproductive morphological characters in plant taxonomy?
Vegetative characters include leaves, stems, and roots, while reproductive characters involve flowers, fruits, and seeds, with reproductive characters often more phylogenetically informative.

To understand the diversification of flowering plant structures, providing key characters for classification and insights into plant-pollinator coevolution.

What is the difference between actinomorphic and zygomorphic flower symmetry in angiosperm classification?
Actinomorphic flowers have radial symmetry and evolved early, while zygomorphic flowers have bilateral symmetry and evolved independently in multiple lineages.

To understand how gene flow between species complicates evolutionary relationships and creates reticulate rather than strictly branching patterns.

What is the difference between homoploid and polyploid hybridization in angiosperm evolution?
Homoploid hybridization occurs without chromosome change, while polyploid hybridization involves genome duplication and often leads to instant speciation.
