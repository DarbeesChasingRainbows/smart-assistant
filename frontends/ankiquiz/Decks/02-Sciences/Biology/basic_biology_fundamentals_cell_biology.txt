To move substances across cell membranes, maintaining essential concentrations and enabling cellular function.

What is the difference between passive and active transport across membranes?
Passive transport moves substances down concentration gradients without energy, while active transport requires energy to move against gradients.

What is the primary purpose of diffusion in cellular processes?
To allow molecules to move from areas of high concentration to low concentration, enabling essential substance distribution.

What is the difference between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion?
Simple diffusion occurs directly through the membrane, while facilitated diffusion requires protein channels or carriers.

What is the primary purpose of osmosis in water balance?
To regulate water movement across membranes, maintaining proper cellular hydration and function.

What is the difference between hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic solutions?
