// Linux Operating System Fundamentals Deck

What is the primary difference between Linux and Unix operating systems?
Linux is a Unix-like open-source kernel created by Linus Torvalds, while Unix refers to a family of operating systems that include both proprietary and open-source implementations.

What is the basic command to check the Linux kernel version?
"uname -r" which displays the kernel release version, or "uname -a" for complete system information including kernel version.

What is the difference between the Linux kernel and a Linux distribution?
The kernel is the core component managing hardware and system resources, while a distribution includes the kernel plus user-space tools, applications, and package management.

What is the primary purpose of the init process (PID 1) in Linux?
To initialize the system, start essential services, and manage process lifecycle, traditionally handled by sysvinit or systemd in modern systems.

What is the basic command to view running processes in Linux?
"ps aux" which displays all running processes with detailed information including user, CPU usage, memory, and command.

What is the difference between PID and PPID in Linux processes?
PID (Process ID) uniquely identifies a process, while PPID (Parent Process ID) identifies the parent process that created the current process.

What is the primary purpose of the /proc filesystem in Linux?
To provide a virtual filesystem interface to kernel data structures, allowing users to view and sometimes modify system information and process details.

What is the basic command to view CPU information through /proc?
"cat /proc/cpuinfo" which displays detailed processor information including model, speed, cache sizes, and core counts.

What is the difference between /proc and /sys filesystems?
/proc provides process and system information interfaces, while /sys provides kernel object and device management interfaces for system configuration.

What is the primary purpose of the Linux shell environment?
To provide a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system, executing commands, and automating tasks through scripting.

What is the basic command to determine the current shell being used?
"echo $SHELL" which displays the path to the current user's default shell, typically /bin/bash or /bin/zsh.

What is the difference between bash and zsh shells?
Bash is the default GNU shell with broad compatibility, while zsh offers advanced features like better tab completion, themes, and plugin support.

What is the primary purpose of environment variables in Linux?
To store configuration data and system settings that influence process behavior and provide information to applications.

What is the basic command to view all environment variables?
"env" or "printenv" which displays all environment variables currently set for the shell session.

What is the difference between environment variables and shell variables?
Environment variables are inherited by child processes, while shell variables are local to the current shell session.

What is the primary purpose of the PATH environment variable?
To specify directories where the shell should search for executable commands when a command is entered without a full path.

What is the basic command to add a directory to the PATH?
"export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory" which temporarily adds the directory to PATH for the current session.

What is the difference between absolute and relative paths in Linux?
Absolute paths start from the root directory (/) and specify the complete location, while relative paths start from the current working directory.

What is the primary purpose of the Linux file system hierarchy?
To organize files and directories in a standardized structure, ensuring consistency across different Linux distributions and applications.

What is the basic command to navigate to the root directory?
"cd /" which changes the current working directory to the root of the file system.

What is the difference between /bin and /usr/bin directories?
/bin contains essential command binaries for system boot and recovery, while /usr/bin contains most user commands and applications.

What is the primary purpose of the /home directory structure?
To provide personal storage space for user files, configurations, and settings, with each user having a separate subdirectory.

What is the basic command to view your current home directory?
"echo $HOME" or "cd ~" which displays or navigates to the current user's home directory.
