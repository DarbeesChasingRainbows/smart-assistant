Taxonomic revision focuses on classification and relationships of specific plant groups, while floristic treatment covers all plants in geographic regions with identification keys.

What is the primary purpose of dichotomous keys in plant identification?
To provide systematic identification methods using paired contrasting characteristics, allowing step-by-step determination of plant species through observable features.

What is the difference between bracketed and indented dichotomous keys?
Bracketed keys present choices in numbered pairs with equal emphasis, while indented keys show hierarchical relationships through indentation patterns.

What is the primary purpose of polyphasic taxonomy in modern plant classification?
To integrate multiple lines of evidence including morphology, genetics, chemistry, and ecology for comprehensive taxonomic decisions and robust classification systems.

What is the difference between phenetic and cladistic approaches to plant classification?
Phenetic classification groups plants by overall similarity, while cladistic classification focuses on evolutionary relationships and shared derived characteristics.

What is the primary purpose of plant species concepts and boundaries in taxonomy?
To define what constitutes distinct plant species, essential for biodiversity assessment, conservation planning, and understanding evolutionary processes.

What is the difference between biological species concept and phylogenetic species concept in plants?
Biological species concept focuses on interbreeding potential, while phylogenetic species concept emphasizes shared evolutionary history and genetic distinctiveness.

What is the primary purpose of infraspecific taxonomy in plant classification?
To recognize variation below species level through subspecies, varieties, and forms, allowing documentation of geographic variation and local adaptations.

What is the difference between subspecies and variety in plant taxonomy?
Subspecies represent geographically distinct populations with consistent differences, while varieties may occur throughout species range with less pronounced differentiation.

What is the primary purpose of taxonomic priority and conservation in botanical nomenclature?
To maintain name stability through principle of priority, where earliest valid name takes precedence, except when conservation would serve stability better.

What is the difference between priority and typification in nomenclatural stability?
Priority determines which name has precedence based on publication date, while typification fixes names to physical specimens to prevent ambiguity.

What is the primary purpose of electronic publishing and digital taxonomy in modern botany?
To increase accessibility of taxonomic research through online publications, digital keys, and searchable databases, accelerating species discovery and identification.

What is the difference between traditional and digital herbarium specimens in taxonomy?
