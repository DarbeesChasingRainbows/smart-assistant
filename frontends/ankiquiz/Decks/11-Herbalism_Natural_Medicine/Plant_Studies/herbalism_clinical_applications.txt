// Herbalism - Clinical Applications Collection

What is the primary purpose of studying clinical herbal applications?
To apply herbal knowledge safely and effectively in clinical practice through systematic assessment, individualized treatment planning, and integration with conventional healthcare approaches.

What is the difference between herbal assessment and conventional medical diagnosis?
Herbal assessment focuses on holistic patterns, constitutional factors, and underlying imbalances using traditional diagnostic frameworks, while conventional diagnosis identifies specific diseases through laboratory testing and pathological criteria.
