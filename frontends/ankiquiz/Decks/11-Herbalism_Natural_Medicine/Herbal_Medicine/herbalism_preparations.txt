// Herbalism - Herbal Preparations Collection

What is the primary purpose of studying herbal preparation methods?
To extract optimal therapeutic compounds from plants, ensure product stability and bioavailability, and create appropriate delivery forms for specific conditions and patient needs.

What is the difference between extraction and formulation in herbal medicine?
Extraction isolates therapeutic compounds from plant material using solvents, while formulation combines extracts and other ingredients into stable, effective final products.
