// Latin Grammar & Syntax Deck

What is the primary purpose of Latin case system?
To indicate the grammatical function of nouns and pronouns through endings rather than word order, allowing flexible sentence structure.

What are the six Latin cases and their basic functions?
Nominative (subject), Genitive (possession), Dative (indirect object), Accusative (direct object), Ablative (means/manner/location), Vocative (direct address).

What is the difference between syntactic and semantic case functions in Latin?
Syntactic functions show grammatical roles (subject, object), while semantic functions show meaning relationships (location, time, manner).

What is the primary purpose of Latin gender in nouns?
To require adjective agreement and determine pronoun usage, though grammatical gender often doesn't match natural gender.

What is the difference between grammatical and natural gender in Latin?
Grammatical gender is a linguistic property (mēnsa is feminine), while natural gender refers to biological sex (vir is masculine, fēmina is feminine).

What is the primary purpose of Latin number in nouns?
To indicate singular or plural quantity, affecting noun endings and adjective agreement throughout the sentence.

What is the difference between singular and plural patterns across declensions?
Each declension has characteristic singular and plural endings (first: -a/-ae, second: -us/-ī, third: various endings/-ēs).

What is the primary purpose of Latin verb conjugations?
To organize verbs into systematic patterns based on their infinitive endings, allowing predictable formation of all tenses and moods.

What is the difference between regular and irregular conjugation patterns in Latin?
Regular verbs follow predictable patterns within their conjugation, while irregular verbs have unique forms that deviate from standard patterns.

What is the primary purpose of Latin verb tenses?
To indicate the time of action (past, present, future) and aspect (completed, ongoing, simple) through systematic verb endings.

What is the difference between absolute and relative tense systems in Latin?
Absolute tenses relate to the present moment (present, perfect, future), while relative tenses relate to other events (imperfect, pluperfect, future perfect).

What is the primary purpose of Latin verb moods?
To express the speaker's attitude toward the action (indicative for facts, subjunctive for potential, imperative for commands).

What is the difference between indicative and subjunctive mood usage in Latin?
Indicative states facts or asks questions about reality, while subjunctive expresses wishes, possibilities, or contrary-to-fact situations.

What is the primary purpose of Latin verb voices?
To show whether the subject performs the action (active) or receives the action (passive), affecting verb endings and meaning.

What is the difference between active and passive voice formation in Latin?
Active voice uses standard personal endings, while passive voice uses different endings and often requires auxiliary verbs in compound tenses.

What is the primary purpose of Latin infinitives?
To function as verbal nouns that can act as subjects, objects, or complements, expressing the concept of the verb without person or number.

What is the difference between present and perfect infinitives in Latin?
Present infinitives express simultaneous or ongoing action (amāre = to love), while perfect infinitives express completed action (amāvisse = to have loved).

What is the primary purpose of Latin participles?
To combine verb and adjective characteristics, allowing verbs to modify nouns while showing tense and voice information.

Present active participles show ongoing action (amāns = loving), while perfect passive participles show completed action (amātus = having been loved).

What is the primary purpose of Latin gerunds?
To function as verbal nouns that decline like second declension neuter nouns, expressing the concept of the verb in various cases.

What is the primary purpose of Latin deponent verbs?
To have passive verb forms but active meanings, requiring active translations despite using passive endings and formations.

What is the difference between deponent and passive verbs in Latin?
Deponent verbs translate actively (sequor = I follow), while true passive verbs translate passively (amātur = he is loved).

What is the primary purpose of Latin semi-deponent verbs?
To have active forms in present system but passive forms in perfect system, combining characteristics of both patterns.

What is the primary purpose of Latin irregular verbs?
To provide essential verbs that don't follow standard conjugation patterns, requiring individual memorization of unique forms.
